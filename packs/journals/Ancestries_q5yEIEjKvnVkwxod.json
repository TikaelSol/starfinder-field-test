The first androids were created by humanoid peoples in their own images, but after the technology that animated the living constructs spread, androids began displaying a fantastic diversity of forms. Androids in the Pact Worlds were originally designed as servants, but today androids stand as equals to other citizens under the Pact. Many androids have formed their own independent communities, while others integrate seamlessly into Pact Worlds societies. Unlike many other technological constructs, androids are more than intricate synthetic organs and complex programming, and each possesses their own soul.</em></p><hr /><p>Androids thrive in nearly any environment and exist as part of myriad cultures, meaning they can be found almost anywhere in the galaxy. Many androids are curious about their origins, traveling alone or with others in search of answers to a variety of metaphysical and material questions about their identities and the greater cosmos. Androids are diverse, with few individuals sharing the exact same appearance despite their manufactured state.</p><p>If you want to roleplay a character on a journey of self-discovery, you should play an android.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Try to avoid having others take advantage of you.</li><li>Seek to understand your purpose in the wider galaxy.</li><li>Judge others based on how they treat service workers, blue collar laborers, fans, or pets.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Have trouble parsing your emotions or understanding when you express them.</li><li>Secretly covet your lack of aging.</li><li>Have some level of guilt for their ancestors' use of your ancestry as laborers</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Androids are biomechanical constructs who typically resemble humanoids with glowing circuitry. Most were created in specialized birthing sites called foundries. Older variants of androids (such as androids on Golarion from the Pathfinder RPG) were primarily biological, but androids in the modern era usually incorporate more technological components and synthetic elements into their bodies. Androids need to eat and sleep, but they don't reproduce, don't age, and have no innate concept of gender—though many express humanoid gender identities or shift fluidly between them. Most androids voluntarily release their bodies after a century or so, allowing new souls to inhabit them in a process called renewal.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Androids tend to be cautious when visiting new places and meeting new people. Once comfortable, androids tend to form tight bonds of friendship and kinship, forming found families, and adopting entire streets and communities as their home, rather than remaining confined by the boundaries formed by walls. Androids often go out of their way to help one another and their chosen families and communities, and most loathe to end the life of another android, knowing that to do so ends not one life, but the countless other souls who could one day inhabit that body.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Androids hold a variety of religious and philosophical views, with individuals sometimes collecting beliefs and practices through decades of lived experiences. Similar to elves and other long-lived ancestries, androids tend to view things differently than beings with shorter life spans. Many androids are patient in achieving their goals, and they might create plans that span decades, if not centuries, hoping they'll still be alive to experience the results. Elder androids who voluntarily pass on to the next part of their cycle might choose to bequeath their goals to the next soul to inhabit their body.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> discover your origins, plan for the future, help others achieve liberation</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> engage in reckless or self-destructive behavior</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Asha, Blue-17, Celita, Daniv, Emene-3, Era-4, Flick, Garro, Historia-6, Hope-1, Iseph, Melody, Naga, Olas, Omen, Prime, Ruby-17, Stringer, Twenty Six, Urdun, Verity-3, and Yose.</p><h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Android Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Charisma</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Vesk tend to embrace conflict and respect strength and military might.</em></p><hr /><p>Vesk have a long history of conflict, first as conquerors within their own star system and later in clashes with neighboring stellar powers, such as the Pact Worlds and the Swarm. Currently, the Veskarium are poised on the brink of war with the Azlanti Star Empire. Conflict permeates most aspects of vesk cultures, creating powerful militaristic empires devoted to the bloody worship of their warrior god Damoritosh. Their brutal history and militaristic values have shaped vesk society, which often embraces conflict and values strength, duty, and honor. Individual vesk are just as likely to apply these cultural values to other aspects of life besides battle, notably in business and sports, and vesk might abandon or oppose the ruthless values enforced by the rulers of their homeworlds entirely. It's up to each vesk to claim their role as a conqueror or a collaborator—or something else entirely.</p><p>If you want a character who's duty bound, honorable, and stoic, you should play a vesk.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Relish the chance to prove yourself in combat against worthy opponents.</li><li>Have a strong sense of duty and honor.</li><li>Surprise your companions with tenderness and emotional outbursts in private.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Respect and fear your brutal reputation but appreciate your strength as an ally.</li><li>Mistake your stoicism for heartlessness.</li><li>Fear facing you in battle.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Vesk stand up to 7 feet tall, are generally muscular, and are covered in tough, scaly skin. Spiky horns grow from their skulls and form bony \"beards\" along their jaws that sometimes extend down their spines to their powerful tails. Vesk scales generally appear in shades of green but can also display vibrant, mottled coloration that's sometimes considered an indicator of health and attractiveness.</p><p>Vesk adopted technological weapons early in their history but retain the brutal claws and teeth of natural predators. They take great care in grooming and painting their scales and claws to showcase their personal style and intimidate others.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Vesk society is highly organized and militaristic. Vesk first dwelled on a single planet but quickly spread to other worlds in their system. Today, the name for these conquered worlds is the Veskarium, with each given a number to mark their distance from the sun (such as Vesk-6). Vesk Prime, the vesk ancestral home, is the seat of Veskarium government and the heart of their traditional culture.</p><p>In the Veskarium, social status is based around battlefield experience, usually earned through military service or mercenary work. Vesk culture strictly dictates everything from interpersonal behavior to mode of dress, and many vesk take pride in upholding these traditions. Vesk value stoicism outside of intimate relationships (including those forged through intense battle) and often follow rigid rules of etiquette. Breaking social customs or insulting a stranger could trigger a violent blood debt, so many vesk default to polite aloofness.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Most vesk in the Veskarium honor Damoritosh the Conqueror, god of duty and war, and his army of battle saints. In life, the saints were mortal paragons who embodied vesk cultural values and attained divinity after earning Damoritosh's blessing; now, they're worshipped alongside their deity. A typical vesk faces all of life's struggles armed with ideals of honor and strength, recognizing that not all conflicts occur on the battlefield. Many vesk find comfort in rigid systems of law, while others hold their personal sense of morality above all else—in either case, most vesk don't hesitate to fight for what they believe is right. Even while fighting, vesk apply a code of honor to their actions, and conflicts within the Veskarium tend to be as disciplined as they are violent, stretching to accommodate opposing sides following the prescribed order of war and maintaining honor. A typical vesk always respects their opponent and shuns tactics considered dishonorable, such as executing prisoners or harming civilians.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> battle honorably, keep private emotions in check, never show weakness to enemies</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> betray an ally</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Vesk names typically combine elements of their parents' names as well as those of other prominent ancestors. Companions often shorten these names for casual use, but doing so without permission is a grave insult. Some vesk take on epithets that signify their victories in combat, such as \"Three Guns\", \"Voidwalker\", or \"Squadeater\".</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Abazobari, Ahadigar, Asthonad, Dotralan, Evdokayo, Goromitali, Julukesh, Katara, Obozaya, Oromeras, Radokama, Sarangari, Sobok, Terikoraz, Vindasorn, and Yuluzak.</p><h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Vesk Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 10</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 20 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Constitution, Strength, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Vesk, One regional language of your choice</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Early-stage barathus tend to be individualistic and gravitate toward learning about other cultures, while more experienced barathus develop a fluid sense of self and seek communion with others on a deeper level.</p><p>If you want a character with an alien appearance and mindset who adapts to any situation, you should play a barathu.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Enjoy new experiences and eagerly adapt to new ideas.</li><li>Change your body frequently based on the environment or situation.</li><li>Merge with your companions or copy their genetic structure to learn about them.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Are intrigued by your unique anatomy.</li><li>Admire your adaptability.</li><li>Struggle to recognize your frequently changing appearance.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>The average barathu has a floating, blimplike body with colorful tentacles and limbs dangling from it. Since barathus frequently change their bodies at a genetic level, a barathu might experience dozens of unique evolutions in their lifetime. Barathus mold themselves into larger, more fantastical forms after merging. Barathu conglomerates might appear as enormous jellyfish, blooming ooze-flowers, or rainbow-colored rings.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Most barathus have a fluid sense of self. In their early stage, young barathus often take inspiration from other cultures and exhibit more individualistic tendencies, then temper this worldview as they gain experience and merge with others. A barathu can merge with other barathus into a compound being called a conglomerate. A barathu conglomerate is greater than the sum of its parts, with an entirely new identity and worldview created by the fusion. Barathus who split back into their component parts recall only hazy memories from their time within the conglomerate, described by some as watching a holovid reel. While young barathus tend to find this disconcerting, most older barathus consider joining a conglomerate an honor. As their bodies and memories begin to fade with age, many barathus choose to merge permanently with a conglomerate, letting go of their individual self to join a greater consciousness and being.</p><p>Because many barathus \"move past\" individuality as they age and embrace adaptation and merging as a solution to most problems and disputes, they can have difficulty fitting in among other societies. Many barathus have trouble understanding greed, ownership, jealousy, and stagnation, often forgetting that their companions can't change their own bodies without magical or technological aid, or their viewpoints without great consideration and time. They're unaccustomed to the static.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Many barathus identify with Oras and choose to explore his faith, seeing their own constant evolution as a mirror of his journey from cell to god. Barathus who explored Liavara and experienced its cosmic song have their own beliefs, which they share in songs unfathomable to everyone except other Dreamers. A barathu's worldview and religion shifts throughout their lifetime as they merge with others and literally expand their mind.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> work together to solve problems, adapt to new situations, change your body into the shape you choose</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> tackle problems on your own</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Barathu names change when they merge into new entities and split back into their component parts. Many early-stage barathus choose their own names, selecting words for concepts that resonate with them or making combinations of sounds they find pleasing.</p><p><strong>Sample Names</strong>: Some barathu names include Ataraxia, Breeze, Bubble in Flight, Dololola, Evanessa, Gleelee, Harmony of Many, Ixeelu, Lilting Song, Sigh, Tenfold Storm, Unity of Purpose, Vortex, Wonder Among Iridescent Clouds, Xonswe, and Y.</p><h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Barathu Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet; fly 20 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Brethedan</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Ambitious, creative, and endlessly curious, humans maintain a robust presence in the galaxy, often taking on positions of leadership or acting at the forefront of exploration. Today, humans can be found almost anywhere doing almost anything.</em></p><hr /><p>Human ambition has created empires throughout the stars. The Pact Worlds have a strong human presence, and the expansion of the Azlanti Star Empire is a more sinister expression of humanity's potential. Though the Azlanti Star Empire is considered a bastion of oppression, there are countless diverse and inclusive societies established by humanity across the galaxy, and humans played a role in founding the most famous port in the known cosmos: Absalom Station. Regardless of their motives, humans thrive in both urban sprawls and in the most remote galactic frontiers.</p><p>If you want an adaptable character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Strive to achieve greatness, either for personal gain or on behalf of a cause.</li><li>Yearn to explore and experience the cosmos.</li><li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Respect your flexibility and usual open-mindedness.</li><li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li><li>Struggle to recognize your frequently changing appearance.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Humans' physical characteristics vary based on their lineage and homeworld. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Some environments produce distinct human appearances, such as crimson-skinned hylki humans living on Akiton. Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Human societies are as varied as the worlds they thrive on. While the Azlanti Star Empire seeks to recapture an imagined era of glory by isolating and idealizing an ancient culture from lost Golarion, most human groups coexist with other species in diverse communities. These vast cultural differences can be both fascinating and frustrating to other ancestries. Human settlements just a few miles apart may have wildly different governmental styles and social mores.</p><p>Furthermore, human societies are always in flux—constantly adapting to new ideas, discoveries, and technologies. Despite their diverse lifestyles and outlooks, humans are adaptive and ambitious—traits which have driven them to explore the unknown, forge their own futures, and settle on countless planets, creating lives for themselves by either integrating into alien societies or creating communities and settlements on distant worlds.</p><p>Of all the common ancestries in the Pact Worlds, humans were perhaps the hardest hit by the Gap. Due to Golarion's disappearance, humans were left with relatively little evidence with which to puzzle out and reconstruct their society. While Absalom Station and other worlds with large human populations contain documents related to the ancient history of humanity, how much relevance this should have to modern human society is a hotly debated topic. For some, these ancient documents offer a chance to connect with their origin, pulling everything from names and philosophies to ancient factions forward into the modern era. To some, this approach is seen as counterintuitive.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Humans often believe in the structures they've established, so many adhere to the ideals of the Pact or follow the laws of other regions or organizations, like the Azlanti Star Empire or the Free Captains. Many also cleave tightly to faith, philosophy, or religion, finding in these intellectual and spiritual touchstones confidence, clarity, and comfort. Since humanity eagerly embraces change, there are always humans who oppose societal norms by challenging longstanding beliefs or laws. These ideals, whether societal, intellectual, or spiritual, are often used as a driving force or justification for a human's behavior and ambitions.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> explore the cosmos, strive for greatness, devote yourself to a greater cause</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> waste what little time you have</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally follow ancient traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of Absalom Station have different names than those dwelling on Akiton or Verces. Humans throughout much of the galaxy speak Common, which is believed to be a language originally spoken on Golarion, yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p><p><strong>Sample Names</strong>: Akif, Alezandaru, Amare, Baolo, Belor, Darilian, Hadzi, Hai Minh, Hiriko, Iolana, Jokug, Korva, Morvius, Navasi, Pao, Pasara, Raziya, Revhi, Sahba, Seoni, Sephia, Signe, Valeros, Valki, Yon, and Zamir.</p><h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Human Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Two free attribute boosts</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Striving for cosmic balance in all things, kasathas take pride in tempering their technological advances with the wisdom of their ancestors.</em></p><hr /><p>Kasathas are originally from the desert planet of Kasath, a doomed world orbiting a red giant. Shortly after the period of lost history known as the Gap, they were convinced by members of their progenitor species, witchwyrds, to leave Kasath and settle on distant the red world in the Golarion system known as Akiton. Centuries later they arrived in the Pact Worlds system aboard the worldship Idari, only to find a thriving planet already inhabited by multitudes of other species. Most kasathas decided to stay onboard the Idari, while others peacefully emigrated to the many planets of the Pact Worlds, where their scientific and metaphysical knowledge are a welcomed addition to the diverse star system. Today, kasathas are found throughougt the Pact Worlds and even in several Near Space systems.</p><p>If you want a character who strives for balance and harmony, you should play a kasatha.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Seek to maintain balance and harmony between yourself and others, as well as among cosmic forces.</li><li>Find traditional weaponry to be more honorable than modern munitions.</li><li>Keep your mouth hidden with a scarf or mask while in public.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume your respect for tradition gives you an inflexible view of the universe.</li><li>Go to you for advice and expect you to provide guidance and wisdom.</li><li>Take your prioritization of personal dignity as a sign of elitism.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Kasathas are humanoids with gray skin, four arms, and pure black eyes. They have an elongated skull that extends behind their neck, further accentuating their tall frames. After evolving to survive migrations on a massive world, many kasathas have wiry bodies with thick musculature that makes them strong despite their lanky appearance.</p><p>Kasathas reach adulthood around the age of 25 and typically live for 100 to 140 years. Kasathas of mixed ancestry tend to come from families who left Idari during the species' initial wave of emigration; these kasathas often use their Tempering to seek out elders who can teach them more about their traditions. Many kasathan familial communities appreciate the unique perspective these individuals can provide as kasathas learn to adapt to new homes and environments.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Kasathan culture prioritizes stability and balance, with a respect for honor, tradition, and the importance of upholding and respecting one's edicts and anathema. Most kasathas form matriarchal and nomadic clans and subclans organized into a complex myriad of \"Great Families.\" While each Great Family has its own set of customs and traditions, common staples include concealing one's mouth from all but your most intimate companions, a belief in the honor of fighting with melee weapons, and a coming-of-age period known as the Tempering, a year-long journey in which a kasatha is encouraged to test their limits, learn from different cultures, and forgo familial customs in the hopes of learning firsthand the importance of stability and tradition.</p><p>In the ancient past, kasathas developed a shared language, which had hundreds of dialects and sublanguages derived from Kasath's ancient nations and powerful Great Families. Dozens more dialects originated on the Idari during its long journey across the galaxy, usually derived from sectors, neighborhoods, and vocations. Thanks to their longstanding respect for tradition and reverence of history, many of these dialects live on and are still spoken in the Pact Worlds to this day.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Kasathan cultures hold custom and ancestral tradition in high regard, but each kasatha follows their own unique set of traditions, combining the rituals of their clan with those they develop through life experience. This accumulation of traditions and customs often inspires older kasathas to spend time remembering and honoring the past daily.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> maintain balance, honor your traditions, establish your own customs, cover your mouth in public</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> disrespect or belittle the traditions of others, disrespect your elders</p><h2>Names</h2><p>While most kasathas go by their first name, many have a full name consisting of up to a half a dozen elements referring to one's ancestors, clan, and connection to the Great Families of Kasath. For example, a kasatha properly named \"Barasul Naedarin Allar of Clan Allar and House Holdare, Keeper of Ten Million Thoughts\" would likely introduce themself as Barasul.</p><p><strong>Sample Names</strong>: Altronus, Barasul, Ehu, Esar, Gorsen, Hadif, Jahir, Kala, Khsutil, Maeda, Metweska, Ninura, Remu, Senesel, Tolar, Umana, Voloteo, Zye.</p><h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Kasatha Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Wisdom, Free</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Kasatha, One regional language of your choice</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Lashuntas manipulate their own genetics at puberty, allowing each individual to develop into an enhanced scholar or warrior, though not every lashunta commits to these traditional choices.</em></p><hr /><p>Lashuntas are natural psychics with adaptive genetics, who traditionally develop into one of two heritages at puberty: damayas or korashas. They have a well-earned reputation for being ambitious, driven, and self-reflective, with a perpetual desire for growth—both in terms of personal advancement and self-improvement. This cultural push to know oneself, embrace one's strengths, surpass one's past successes, and strive for ever-greater goals drives lashuntas to value education, focus, and training, and to embrace new discoveries, technologies, and modes of thought. While many lashuntas today still fulfill the traditional role of the enlightened warrior or the consummate scholar, time and shifting social norms have gifted lashuntas the freedom to branch out in countless ways, developing their own interests, hobbies, and genetic expressions, with no regard to their heritage or societal standing.</p><p>If you want to play a character who strives for self-perfection and has innate psychic abilities, you should play a lashunta.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Constantly strive to improve yourself through practicing skills and honing your powers.</li><li>Prioritize learning and diplomacy if you're a damaya, or physique and tactical prowess if you're a korasha—or if you're an unbound lashunta, you don't fit into either mold.</li><li>Hold yourself to a much higher standard than you apply to others.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Think you're a perfectionist and find your pursuit of self-improvement tiresome.</li><li>Distrust your psychic abilities, fearing you'll read their minds.</li><li>Idealize or label you based on your chosen heritage.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>To survive on an inimical homeworld, lashuntas evolved adaptive genetics that allow them to develop into one of two heritages: damayas or korashas. Damayas tend to be tall and graceful with delicate features and are traditionally pushed toward intellectual pursuits and political occupations. Korashas are shorter, more muscular, and gravitate toward military service, exploration, and wartime leadership. Regardless of heritage, all lashuntas have short forehead antennae that focus their telepathy, with colorful bumps and markings on their face unique to each individual. Lashuntas produce pheromones that subtly broadcast their moods in ways that other ancestries may find alluring or unnerving.</p><p>Around puberty, lashuntas traditionally choose whether to express damaya or korasha genetics—a decision that determines their physical development and influences their societal roles. Lashuntas achieve their choice through a combination of psychic ritual and gene therapy. Today, many young lashuntas have chosen to tread their own path and abstain from this choice, instead becoming \"unbound.\" Unbound lashuntas defy traditional roles and labels, and they may express traits and innate proclivities common to both or neither group. A growing minority of lashuntas instead push for further genetic diversification and aim to express unique or long-buried genetic permutations, pioneering entirely new chosen heritages. Whether such experimentation will prove fruitful is unknown.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Since time immemorial, lashuntas have dwelled in sprawling, picturesque cities along the shores and wildlands of Castrovel, a lush jungle world teeming with dangerous predators and extreme weather. These independent settlements are protected by a mighty military caste of psychic warriors, technological defenses, and magical countermeasures. The most iconic of these soldiers are the shotalashu cavalry, lightly armored riders who form telepathic bonds with (and take their name from) their saurian mounts.</p><p>Lashuntas share their homeworld of Castrovel with communities of reclusive elves and empires of fanatically orderly insectile formians. Peace between lashuntas and formians remains tentative and hard earned after unknown ages of open warfare, which began millennia before the Gap. While lashuntas are most commonly found on Castrovel, the planet's ancient transportation portals and the more recent Lashuntas evolved psychic abilities and a unique dimorphism that helped them survive on their homeworld of Castrovel. Lashuntas manipulate their own genetics at puberty, allowing each individual to develop into an enhanced scholar or warrior, though not every lashunta commits to these traditional choices. advent of space travel has led many lashuntas to settle throughout the Pact Worlds and beyond.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Lashunta cultures value education, self-improvement, and community defense. Religious lashuntas tend to identify with faiths that encourage balance, knowledge, meditative practice, and seeking enlightenment, such as Eloritu, Ibra, or Yaraesa. Other lashuntas shun religion entirely in favor of adopting a philosophy like the Cycle or the Green Faith, honoring a state leader, or following historic community traditions.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> never stop learning, train your mind or body daily, become the best version of yourself</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> neglect your goals, wallow in failure</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Lashunta naming conventions often use tonal elements.</p><p><strong>Sample Names</strong>: Domash, Hesori, Imaaz, Kima, Kopalo, Maenala, Nomae, Oraeus, Raia, Shess, Soryn, Stretto, Taeon, and Varikuara.</p><h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Lashunta Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Charisma, Free</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Lashunta, Castrovelian, One regional language of your choice</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

Their homeworld was recently freed from occupation by the Veskarium and they've joined the Pact Worlds.</em></p><hr /><p>Pahtras evolved on a low-gravity jungle world called Pulonis, where they fought a generations-spanning war for independence from their Veskarium conquerors. Recently, pahtra freedom fighters defeated the last Veskarium occupiers, then voted to join the Pact Worlds as a sovereign planet. Today, Pulonis is a lush, verdant world wracked by dangerous magnetic storms and scarred by the Veskarium's brutal invasion. The struggles of survival have influenced many pahtra traditions, leading to a culture of competitive wargames, time-honored mysticism, and unorthodox technology. Music accompanies everything in pahtra culture, from popular entertainment to traditional battle tactics, with martial combat even categorized as a form of battle dance.</p><p>If you want to play a character who fights for freedom with grace and style, you should play a pahtra.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Enjoy friendly competition.</li><li>Be a talented performer or cultured aficionado of a wide variety of music and dance.</li><li>Hold true to your ancestral traditions and refuse to kneel to cruel despots.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Think you struggle with computers, vehicles, and other technology.</li><li>Envy your musical talent.</li><li>Assume you are looking for an excuse to prove yourself in a fight.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Pahtras are feline humanoids covered in fur. Their coats vary from black, white, blue, calico, bi-colored, and tabby, often possessing unique patterns of irregular shapes that seers traditionally use to divine an individual's potential. Their eyes vary across all colors of the visible spectrum. Typical pahtras stand between six and seven feet tall, with elongated limbs and flexible joints. Their physiology is highly mutable, and families that leave Pulonis often find their children developing stockier and more muscular bodies as they adjust to higher gravity.</p><p>Pahtras have sharp teeth and retractable claws on their hands and feet. They have a unique set of sensory organs across their muzzles, with functions varying from individual to individual. The most common of these peripheral nerves include harmonic sensory apparatuses that can feel sound. Others have longer whiskers that can sense magnetic or magical energies. Some pahtras can even sniff out infection or illness, making them invaluable as health care providers, colonists exploring new worlds, or even traditional brewers, who can hone the skill to detect the presence of unwanted contaminants.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Pahtra cultures are steeped in tradition and highly competitive, with individuals vying for recognition and resources in a struggle that mimics the harsh natural order of their planet. Before the Veskarium invasion, technological advancement on Pulonis stalled because of the world's unpredictable magnetic storms. Even today, Pulonian technological development focuses on ceramics, bioengineering, chemistry, and magic. After breaking from the Veskarium, residents of Pulonis's nation-states overwhelmingly voted to join the Pact Worlds, and they're still acclimating to this new political allegiance.</p><p>The majority of pahtras are asexual. Most seek loving and life-long relationships with partners, but in modern times few commit to having children. Pahtras bear litters of six to eight children and prefer communal child-rearing, which allows parents to retain their individuality.</p><p>When a pahtra comes of age at 15, they participate in ceremonial wargames in the wilderness. Though these ancient rites of battle and survival are dangerous and last several weeks, they remain popular today, and their results often determine a pahtra's career prospects and place in society. Those pahtras wishing to participate in a less dangerous fashion instead participate in dance competitions, complex choreographed ritual dances, or grueling marathons, which offer participants less prestige but have a much lower mortality rate.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Many pahtras cling fiercely to their ancestral Pulonian traditions in an effort to keep their cultures alive after enduring generations of oppression by the Veskarium. Pulonian culture values personal success and standing out from one's peers and views all existence as a great song, with each person, event, and action adding to the galactic symphony that began at the dawn of time. Most pahtras enjoy healthy and productive competition, believing that one's true potential can only emerge from struggle. Underhandedly sabotaging or blatantly disrespecting a rival who follows the rules of a competition is a grave offense and usually seen as a sign of weakness. Pahtras make an exception to this code when facing a dishonorable foe, such as invaders from the technologically advanced Veskarium. In such cases, any form of resistance is acceptable, and the use of \"dirty\" tactics is considered a wise counter to a foe's unfair advantages. Many religious pahtras pray to Meyel, an ancestral deity of dance, music, and battle worshipped on Pulonis.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> challenge yourself and your comrades, take pride in your accomplishments, perform music and dance daily</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> abandon your ancestral traditions, give up your identity, bow to tyrants</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Traditionally, a seer divines a pahtra child's future based on their fur patterns. While most pahtra parents embrace this predestination ritual wholeheartedly, others consider it an opportunity to celebrate their child's birth and survival, give their child a traditional name, and pay homage to their ancestors. These pahtras instead interpret the mystic readings as ancient wisdom to be applied broadly, rather than dictating a specific fate or destiny for their child. Some pahtras from the youngest generations scoff at these traditions entirely, Pahtras are a humanoid feline species from a nearby star system. They're highly competitive and are known for their achievements in magic, music, and war.

Shirrens walk upright and have three sets of limbs with three-clawed hands. The lower, weaker pairs of limbs are generally kept concealed}] and only used for ceremonial and reproductive purposes. Shirrens vary in appearance based on the Swarm colony they descended from, and some have vestigial wings, segmented thoraxes, or stingers. Shirrens' exoskeletons are often colorful, iridescent, and may have spots or other patterns.</p><p>Shirrens have three sexes with roles in reproduction: male, female, and host. Female and male shirrens provide eggs and sperm respectively, and hosts incubate the fertilized eggs while adding their own genetic material. In some shirren communities, a single host incubates for many partners, while three-party unions are common in others. Shirren young spend their first 2 years in a wormlike larval form. A parent may carry their larval child in a protective container to let them safely experience the world until they reach the pupal stage. Pupae undergo a second metamorphosis around eight years old before settling into their mature form. During each metamorphosis, shirrens instinctively and unconsciously edit and adjust their own appearance, physiology, and sex, to better represent the person they're maturing into.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Shirrens are highly individualistic, having escaped from the Swarm thanks to an adaptation to their physiology that causes immense pleasure when they make choices for themselves. This freedom of choice is respected and nourished by shirren culture, leading shirrens to adapt themselves to a wide variety of beliefs, philosophies, and professions. Shirrens are highly communal and tend to feel lonely unless they're part of a group. Once a shirren chooses a community for themselves, they often seek to foster teamwork and prioritize what's best for the group over what only benefits them as individuals, all while retaining their autonomy.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Shirrens define themselves by their choices and bristle against all forms of oppression. They enjoy cultural exchange, and while most eagerly adopt the deities and practices of other communities, others hold passionately atheistic worldviews The insectile shirrens split from the destructive Swarm, forsaking the ruthless hive mind to pursue their own freedom and end the cycle of interstellar violence.

Driven by an insatiable desire to help those around them, they perform countless acts of kindness with a chaotic enthusiasm that borders on manic.</em></p><hr /><p>Skittermanders are the original inhabitants of Oeddertchonk, a planet which was conquered by the Veskarium long before the Gap and is more commonly known today as Vesk-3. Colorful in both appearance and personality, skittermanders are excitable and altruistic. They crave community and collaboration and adore making new friends. Regardless of how, skittermanders are always thrilled to help out and lend a hand, and are known throughout the galaxy for their compassion and selflessness.</p><p>Thanks to their desire to help, skittermanders tend to be curious and nosy, and often insert themselves into other people's business and problems. They're easily distracted, and prone to becoming so engrossed in aiding others, that they neglect their own responsibilities and leave their own tasks unfinished. This has given skittermanders a reputation for being flighty, forgetful, or irresponsible.</p><p>If you want to play a character who is friendly, excitable, and loves to help others, you should play a skittermander.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Love to help others, perhaps even prioritizing their needs over your own or feeling anxiety when you can't offer assistance.</li><li>Enjoy meeting new people and making new friends.</li><li>Be easily distracted.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Are in awe of your boundless energy, enthusiasm, and positivity.</li><li>Expect you to provide help without renumeration or compensation for your time and effort.</li><li>Assume you're flighty or unreliable, and don't take your responsibilities seriously.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Skittermanders are short and rotund, with big eyes and wide mouths lined with sharp teeth. They have six arms, leading to their use of the slang term \"allsix\" for giving one's best effort. A skittermander's body is covered in colorful fur, most commonly in vibrant shades of blue, green, purple, or red. Skittermanders are mammals that begin life in a non-sapient larval stage called a whelp. Skitterwhelps look like miniature skittermanders, save that they scrabble around on all eight limbs, have bigger ears, and have a secondary, tube-like mouth that sprouts from their abdomen. Skitterwhelps fend for themselves after birth, devouring fruits, seeds, leaves, raw meat, and any other source of nutrients they can cram into their mouths. A skitterwhelp's stomach-mouth can attach to large prey and secretes numbing saliva, enabling them to cling to large animals and feed on them over time like a furry leech. Despite their diminutive size, they're voracious, capable of eating three-times their weight in food each day. Skitterwhelps mature into skittermanders around the age of six, when their stomach-mouths detach and they gain sapience. They retain their large and undiscerning appetite throughout their lives.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Skittermander societies are at once fluid and predictable. They don't create governments, laws, or rules, yet they naturally help others, forming free-form independent communities or joining neighboring societies. Occasionally temporary leaders Skittermanders are excitable, six-armed humanoids with brightly colored fur. Driven by an insatiable desire to help those around them, they perform countless acts of kindness with a chaotic enthusiasm that borders on manic. emerge to direct big projects or teach an important skill, but this is a matter of talent, not power, as skittermanders adore teamwork and naturally defer to whomever has the most expertise to tackle the task at hand. They're individualistic and selfless; chaotic without being anarchic. They value innovation and spontaneity.</p><p>Communities are tight knit and welcoming, and individuals tend to be friendly, sociable, and engaged. Skittermanders are incredibly talkative, quiet only when focused on a particularly challenging task. Upon encountering another silent skittermander, they often fall silent in turn to help them concentrate, respectful of \"the hush\" that's overtaken their fellow. Oddly, most skittermanders have difficulty discerning when non-skittermanders desire silence, instead attempting to fill the silence with incessant conversation.</p><p>It's said that the skittermander home world of Oeddertchonk was conquered effortlessly by the Veskarium. When the skittermanders realized their vesk visitors wanted to occupy their world, they \"helped\" by simply being elsewhere. In truth, Oeddertchonk is simultaneously an occupied planet of the Veskarium and entirely independent. The skittermanders help the Veskarium when they feel like it, but don't acknowledge Veskarium leadership or governance.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>As a people, skittermanders care little for organized religion, instead passing on their beliefs and values through stories, songs, and art. Skittermanders who choose to worship a god favor those with loose organizational structures and an interest in community, mentorship, friendship, nature, or the stars. The faiths of Hylax, Ibra, Lambatuin, and Weydan tend to resonate most.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> help others, be kind, respect and nurture living beings</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> refuse to help someone in dire need, pollute the environment, cause intentional harm without reason</p><h2>Names</h2><p>A skittermander's name grows as they age and pass certain milestones. A name begins very short, usually no more than one syllable. New syllables are added with the passing of time or whenever the skittermander feels like it. Added syllables are often repetitive, and many skittermanders adopt parts of other foreign names (notably Vesk) into their own.</p><p><strong>Sample Names</strong>: Ayoka, Baazo, Bixby, Dakoyo, Fipzul, Gazigaz, Jomp, Kayoko, Kimikim, Mimzy, Nako, Prismacora, Quonx, Razzlefrazz, Rudfuz, Sprax, Timinim, Tipps, Tonkona, Viverivim, Zerastorfen.</p><h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Skittermander Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Charisma, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Wisdom</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Vesk, One regional language of your choice</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

With roots on countless worlds, ysoki work alongside larger species helping to establish communities and accomplish tough tasks. From the largest of crowds to the tightest of tunnels, a ysoki always knows how to find their way. Only the foolish overlook the presence of a ysoki in a group!</em></p><hr /><p>Ysoki populations thrived on Akiton, lost Golarion, and several other worlds for millennia before spaceflight accelerated cultural exchange in the Pact Worlds system. The question of whether these ethnicities share common ancestors or were examples of convergent evolution isn't important to most ysoki. Often gregarious, ysoki embrace far-flung \"cousins\" regardless of differences in appearance and heredity.</p><p>Most ysoki love technology and travel, even gravitating toward professions that others find unpleasant. Ysoki often work as junkers, longhaul starship crewmembers, or mechanics squeezing through cramped station corridors, so sure of their own worth that living and working in subpar conditions is often a source of pride rather than shame.</p><p>If you want a character who is adventurous, confident, and curious, try playing a ysoki!</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Keep in touch with a large extended family scattered throughout the stars, with a cousin to visit in every port.</li><li>Collect gadgets encountered in your travels and tinker with everything, even your own cybernetic augmentations.</li><li>Adopt your coworkers and friends into a found family.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume you're disorganized and messy until they learn your habits.</li><li>Value your skills with technology but wish you reassembled things as often as you took them apart.</li><li>Depend on you to stick up for others and always get the job done.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Ysoki have whiskered snouts, large ears, and hairless tails, with red or black eyes and fur colors typically in shades of black, brown, gray, and white. Ysoki appearances vary considerably, even within a family unit. Many ysoki have evolved prehensile tails that help them keep their balance and maneuver in zero gravity, as well as keen noses that can identify complex chemicals by smell.</p><p>Ysoki instinctually maintain cleanliness through personal grooming and reinforce these habits throughout their strong social structures. Many ysoki use cosmetics to spice up their looks and favor cybernetic augmentations, often installed at a cousin's bustling street clinic. Ysoki enjoy expressing their personality through fashion, often layering clothing items and accessories into a jumbled fusion. Regardless of attire or profession, ysoki value preparedness and ingenuity, rarely leaving home without a few useful tools and supplies stuffed into a backpack, purse, toolbelt, or cheek pouch.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Ysoki culture values life over credits, framing work as another communal activity to enjoy. Ysoki communities are tightknit and welcoming, always eager to share a meal or swap spare parts with strangers who don't look down on them. Many ysoki adults enjoy distance correspondences with dozens of friends and relatives, reuniting for warren-wide celebrations whenever circumstance brings them back together. Others never leave their homes, serving as pillars of the community and curating collections of useful junk for generations of grandchildren.</p><p>When ysoki aren't exploring or tinkering, they enjoy time in communal warrens planet side or nestled into maintenance tunnels, access corridors, and other spaces often overlooked by larger folk. Ysoki warrens are cluttered with hoarded gadgets and boisterous family members. Hoards full of spare parts and half-finished projects are kept fastidiously clean, and shared living spaces are typically cramped but tidy—though the controlled chaos of a ysoki family's collection might seem like a mess to outsiders.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Ysoki care more about their family than abstract moral concepts, and most ysoki follow their warren's strict social codes even if they flout civil laws. Community is important to ysoki, and they're likely to respect other cultures' social expectations even when they don't agree.</p><p>Ysoki enjoy cultural exchange and acknowledge deities worshipped in their local settlements, but most never lose touch with two cultural touchstones: revering their ancestors and the goddess Lao Shu Po. Lao Shu Po remains important to ysoki culture throughout the stars, with every diasporic ysoki population venerating some version of Grandmother Rat. Lao Shu Po encourages followers to be selfish, engage in trickery, and embodies values most ysoki find indecent, though even upstanding ysoki agree that sometimes these traits are necessary for survival.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> put your community's interests above your own, maintain good personal hygiene, stay in touch with family</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> throw away something that might be useful later</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Nicknames are often as important to ysoki as their given names, and they enjoy giving their friends and family monikers based on their appearance or personality, such as \"Snack,\" \"Dot,\" \"Sparks,\" or \"Boom-Boom.\" Many ysoki family names incorporate their ships or home settlements.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Bena, Coponisa, Cors, Datch, Fitch, Goba, Kib, Lolo, Niknak, Quig, Resk, Sim, and Twik.</p><h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Ysoki Mechanics</h2><p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 6</p><p><strong>Size</strong> Small</p><p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p><p><strong>Attribute Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Intelligence, Free</p><p><strong>Attribute Flaw</strong> Strength</p><p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Ysoki, Akitonian</p><p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if it's positive).

        "content": "<p><em>A borai is simultaneously living and dead—a corpse reanimated by its own soul into something just barely living. Despite being corporeal undead, a borai's body is alive, and functions as a living shell that protects their tattered, undead soul, making them something altogether unique.</em></p><hr /><p>Borais are most often created by others through a botched resurrection attempt (whether magical or technological) or necromantic experimentation, or by oneself through sheer stubborn determination and refusal to accept one's demise. Once a person becomes a borai, their living body and undead soul are inexorably bound to one another. A borai's body draws vitality from the soul, preventing external rot and degradation, while the soul tenaciously clings to their body as a vehicle for corporeality and prolonged life. Even if a borai is killed and resurrected or reincarnated, this bond isn't severed, and a borai always comes back as a borai.</p><p>Unlike many forms of undead, borais are the same person they were before their death—they retain their personality, memories, and feelings, and often seek to maintain the emotional connections and relationships they forged in life. Yet, death has left its mark on borais, and many living beings innately sense something is off about a borai, putting a strain on a borai's relationships and other pre-existing social connections. This slow fracturing of friendships and souring of support systems tends to push borais out of their comfort zone, driving them from their homes and past lives and toward the unknown—an experience that leaves many borais jaded, emotionally guarded, or eager to embrace new experiences.</p><p>If you want to play a character who blurs the lines between living and dead, and who's struggling to find their place in the universe, you should play a borai.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Be determined to succeed and refuse to accept your own failure or defeat.</li><li>Embrace new experiences, places, and relationships, perhaps even recklessly or to your own detriment.</li><li>Fear what killed you or avoid the place you died.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Confuse you with a bonetrooper, corpsefolk, necrovite, or other undead, and become surprised when you breathe, eat, or sleep.</li><li>Find your presence unnerving, even if they can't pinpoint why.</li><li>Seek your advice about grief, loss, death, and the afterlife.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Borais appear as they did in life, save that their skin takes on a pallid, waxy hue, and their blood becomes infused with void energy, turning it into a thick black ichor that's clearly visible through their flesh. As their body is alive, borais must breathe, eat, and sleep, and they can be healed, stabilized, and even resurrected like any other living creature. Borais age at radically slowed rates, allowing them to live for a few additional centuries. After this time, a borai's physical body deteriorates to such a degree that the soul can no longer sustain it; the borai then both dies (as living creatures do) and is destroyed (as undead creatures are). Scholars are divided as to whether these souls move on to their appointed afterlives or deteriorate and immediately re-enter the cycle of souls as raw quintessence in Creation's Forge.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>Borais are reanimated all throughout the galaxy, from the Pact Worlds to the Vast, making them a diverse people with a scattered population. Most borai are \"born\" on Eox or on other planets where necromancy, religious resurrections, and scientific research into immortality are commonplace. Many borais begin their second lives trying to live as they did before their death, living the same lives and maintaining the same routines and relationships—usually while attempting to hide their undead nature using cosmetics, illusions, or augmentations. This is frequently doomed to failure, either because those around them reject their new state, or because the borai themself feels out of place and distant from their life. While some borais choose to travel the galaxy, others migrate to regions more accepting to undead, such as Eox. As borais require the same comforts as living creatures, they have trouble fitting in even within undead societies. A coalition of borais based out of Absalom Station have banded together to petition the Pact Council for official rights to an asteroid or small moon, to create a home planet, though their requests have yet to bear fruit.</p><p>Borais who've lived over a decade as undead tend to consider family a matter of friendship, loyalty, and love, rather than a matter of genetics or lineage. Found families and sprawling friendship groups are common, though some instead find companionship in mercenary or military units, among members of the same social movements or religious institution, or within the cutthroat hierarchy of a corporation or consortium. Some borais embrace their ominous presence and disconcerting aspects, finding employment as terrifying enforcers or imposing bodyguards, while others seek to overcome and erase the stigma of their undead nature by holding diplomatic positions or taking jobs where they interact with the public.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Borais are influenced by the cultures and societies they were born into, and many continue to worship the same gods and cleave to the same philosophies as they did in life. With time, most borais tend to favor gods of emotion or travel, or who hold sway over the dead, such as Weydan, Zon-Shelyn, or Urgathoa. Those who cleave to modern fads and trends, and who manage to keep up with the fast-paced galactic zeitgeist, instead tend to worship Lambatuin. Many borais take solace in a philosophy known as the Song of Silence, which teaches that undeath is the ultimate goal of life, and that one's mortal life is simply a trial run for one's undead life, where one can take the lessons learned through mortality and apply it to their second life, becoming perfected or enlightened.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> embrace new experiences, learn from your past, refuse to accept defeat</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> abandon those who accept you as you are</p><h2>Names</h2><p>No widespread naming conventions exist for borais, and most retain the name that they had in life. Some borais who leave behind their old lives adopt new names of their own creation that they feel better represent their identity heading into the second (or arguably third) phase of their life.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Agavana, Ajanu, Cailis, Enduri, Jiann, Kilarra, Orthei, Ruven, Taylehm, Thel-Sevai, Tis, Yevtori.</p><h2>Boarai Lineages</h2><p>You've returned from the brink of death as a boarai—at once both living and undead. You gain the borai and undead trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. Unlike other undead, you do not gain void healing. You're healed by vitality effects and damaged by void damage, as if you were a living creature. Likewise, you can be stabilized, healed, and brought back to life as if you were a living creature, save that you always return to life in your normal undead state (as a borai). You gain low-light vision, or you gain darkvision if your ancestry already has low-light vision. You can choose from borai feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.feats.Item.ZkEEKl6XmhfhI8fo]{Etheric}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.feats.Item.2rkgm6Pbhltp4DV3]{Headstrong}</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.feats.Item.HCwBHoCgvc50NvFY]{Necrotized}</p>",

Yet, not all children born in the Drift become prismenis, just as not all those born to pious Triunites become prismenis. Most believe that their lineage is a direct result of Triune's blessing, while others believe it comes down to luck, genetics, or a quantifiable scientific factor that's yet to be identified. Some prismenis aren't born but transformed, becoming prismenis only after prolonged close contact with a spectra, being present at a spectra gathering, or after performing a dangerous task on behalf of Triune. In these instances, becoming a prismeni is considered a blessing, granted by Triune to its chosen children. During the recent Drift Crisis, a year-long event that saw the Drift crash and slowly reboot back to functionality, prismenis were born and transformed with incredible frequency, increasing their population and incidentally giving prismenis greater influence on the galactic stage than ever before.</p><p>Like the Drift itself, prismenis are always in motion. They dislike idleness and monotony and sometimes go out of their way to break routine, traditions, and expectations, simply for the excitement of trying something new. This refusal to settle is often literal, with prismenis changing jobs and homes frequently, or drifting in and out of relationships with abandon, but it's just as often immaterial, with prismenis embracing innovation, experimentation, education, or new fads and trends. Prismenis like to travel and explore, usually to places and planets far from their own, and feel a thrill at experiencing the unfamiliar. Many can instinctively control and understand technology or speak wirelessly with technological creatures. Some can create and harness electricity. To many prismenis, entering the Drift feels like coming home, and most describe it as tranquil or soothing. Some prismenis have a connection to the Drift so strong that their body is sustained or rejuvenated by its energies—the Drift nourishes their bodies, heals their wounds, protects them from harm, and settles their ever-racing thoughts.</p><p>If you want to play a character who embraces change and exploration, or who has a connection to the Drift, you should play a prismeni.</p><h2>You Might...</h2><ul><li>Be easily bored by routine, familiar sights and tasks, and predictable outcomes.</li><li>Love to travel and experience new cultures and societies.</li><li>Have an instinctive understanding of technology.</li></ul><h2>Others Probably...</h2><ul><li>Assume you know all about the Drift.</li><li>Expect you to worship Triune or be close friends with a spectra.</li><li>Consider you restless, flighty, or irresponsible.</li></ul><h2>Physical Description</h2><p>Prismenis look similar in appearance to their parents and are instantly recognizable as a member of their ancestry, yet they have unique features that set them apart visually from their peers, such as metallic gray eyes, rainbow-colored locks, thick cords or wire for hair, or flesh that shimmers with different colors in various light. Many have technological or electrical components naturally integrated into their body or can create and manipulate electricity. While within the Drift, prismenis \"come alive\"—their hair, flesh, and eyes become more colorful and vibrant, their countenance more expressive, and their actions more confident.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>While all prismenis are drawn inexorably to the Drift, they rarely stay in one place long and prefer to remain on the move, making gatherings of prismenis few and far between. Sometimes, prismenis incidentally gather at sites important to spectras or Triune, such as Drift beacons, or at exciting, once-in-a-lifetime events—such gatherings are often termed \"flashmeets,\" though religious prismenis tend to believe these gatherings are the will of Triune, drawing its disparate children together in joy or for a shared purpose.</p><p>Regardless of their homes or lifestyles, prismenis value freedom and change. They take joy in discovery and exploration, both physical and intellectual, and understand that nothing lasts forever—nor would they want it to. Most prismenis trust their own feelings and instincts and understand when it's time to leave a relationship, or show understanding when left in turn. They stagnate under the yoke of routines and traditions that they can't escape.</p><h2>Beliefs</h2><p>Thanks to their deep spiritual connection to the Drift, the vast majority of prismenis worship Triune. Those who don't tend to be atheists. Prismenis who worship other gods often favor gods of chaos, change, innovation, or travel, such as Besmara, Prismenis are suffused with the energy of the Drift, a recently discovered hyperspace plane, and are spiritual kin to the spectra who call that plane home. Wherever they go and whatever they do, they carry a fragment of the Drift inside them, and they can access that plane and its power through this internal connection. Oras, Yaraesa, or Weydan.</p><p><strong>Popular Edicts</strong> break with tradition, trust your feelings, visit new places</p><p><strong>Popular Anathema</strong> allow others to dictate your decisions or impede your freedom</p><h2>Names</h2><p>Prismenis hold few naming conventions, selecting names that speak to them on a personal level rather than cultural. Most change their name at least twice in their life, once to shed the name given to them by others for one they feel resonates better with their identity, and again whenever they believe they've changed, learned a great lesson, or otherwise have become someone new. They adore nicknames and appellations, both those given to them by others and chosen for themselves.</p><h3>Sample Names</h3><p>Anon, Coda, Bellasoar, Ector, Freedom's Wing, Ilioch, Jalavel, Ozarin, Red, Sipri, Szazah, Tizera, Una.</p><h2>Prismeni Lineages</h2><p>You have an innate connection to the Drift. You gain the prismeni trait, in addition to the traits from your ancestry. While in the Drift, you can automatically pinpoint the location of Drift beacons, Drift drives, Drift engines, and other Driftrelated technology within a 100-mile radius. If you're Piloting a starship that doesn't have a Drift engine, you can serve as a connection between the Drift and that starship. This is a 1-minute activity that has the concentrate trait, and it allows the starship you're Piloting to enter or exit the Drift. Once within the Drift, the starship travels via conventional thrusters, as normal. When you get a critical failure on a Piloting check to Navigate or Plot Course through the Drift, you get a failure instead. You can choose from prismeni feats and feats from your ancestry whenever you gain an ancestry feat.</p>",
