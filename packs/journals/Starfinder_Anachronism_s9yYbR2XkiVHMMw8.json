This means the creatures will remain, and we aren't going to remove the art files for anything from the module so you can still use those for your game.</li>\n<li>You will need to remake your characters with the full rules. As normal, we don't change things on existing actors any more than is needed to keep them functioning with new code.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Have fun gaming!</p>"
