If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and you must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p><h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2><p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2>Envoy Directive <span style=\"float:right\">Level 1</span></h2><p>Envoys encourage their allies by using directives. A directive is an insight, order, or stratagem that benefits any allies who follow it. Each envoy directive includes a way for the envoy to lead by example. If the envoy takes their own advice and follows through on their own directive before the end of their turn, they unlock an additional advantage for themselves and their allies. By default, most directives have the visual trait, representing the envoy performing guiding motions to assist. However, envoys can choose to replace the visual trait with, or simply add, the auditory trait to represent shouts of encouragement as part of these actions.</p><p>You begin with one envoy directive. You can learn more directives through the envoy class and envoy class feats. You can use any number of directives a round, but you can't use the same directive more than once a round. An envoy's directive and the benefits it grants last until the beginning of your next turn.</p><p>You gain the Get 'Em! envoy directive.</p><h2>Social Mastermind <span style=\"float:right\">Level 1</span></h2><p>You rely on your force of personality and powers of persuasion to influence others, for good or for ill. You gain the activity Size Up and the action Saw it Coming.</p><h2>Leadership Style <span style=\"float:right\">Level 1</span></h2><p>Whether it comes naturally, you trained for it, or you were thrown into a leadership role unexpectedly, you've developed a personal style of leading others. At 1st level, select a leadership style. You become trained in the indicated leadership skill, and you gain the indicated leadership perk.</p><p>At 6th level, certain actions become your acts of leadership and grant you a benefit when you perform those acts. These actions vary depending on your selected leadership style. When you use an act of leadership after issuing one or more envoy directives earlier that turn, you can choose one envoy directive you activated. You grant the lead by example benefits for that directive even if you didn't meet the usual requirements to lead by example. You can do this once per turn.</p><h2>Envoy Feats</h2><p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an envoy class feat.</p><h2>Skill Feats</h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2>Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>You gain more skill increases than members of other classes. At 2nd level and every level thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2>Adaptive Talent <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>You're quick thinking and adaptable, capable of picking up new skills and talents with little practice or training. During your daily preparations, select one skill feat that you meet the prerequisites for. You gain this skill feat until you prepare again. Since you have this feat temporarily, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a permanent character option. You can use this for effects that temporarily give you access to other abilities, such as taking Multilingual to temporarily learn a new language.</p><p>As your envoy level increases, so does your ability to adapt to new situations. At 9th level and 15th level, increase the number of skill feats you gain this way by 1. You can use feats that you temporarily gain through adaptive talent as a prerequisite for other feats that you temporarily gain through adaptive talent, but you still can't use them as prerequisites for permanent character options.</p><h2>General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2>Wise to the Game <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>Using your words to influence others is second nature to you, and you easily recognize when others attempt to use the same tactics against you. You gain a +1 status bonus to your Perception DC against attempts to Feint or Lie to you and attempts to divert your attention with Create a Diversion, and a +1 status bonus to your Will DC against attempts to Demoralize you. This bonus increases to +2 against your asset.</p><h2>Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p><h2>Perception Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>You've a keen eye for details and always manage to remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p><h2>Practiced Influencer <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>You're a master at influencing others and using your skills to get the best result out of a social situation. You rarely say the wrong thing or cause a negotiation to go south. You gain the Practiced Influencer action.</p><h2>Weapon Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>You've learned a few clever tricks with your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert. Whenever you attack your asset or the target of your Get 'Em, you gain access to the critical specialization effects of all weapons for which you have expert proficiency.</p><h2>Fortitude Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Improvised Mastery <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Whether by luck or instinct, you display impressive talent on the fly. You gain the Improvised Mastery action.</p><h2>Leader's Confidence <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Whether you're cool and collected or voicing confidence through gritted teeth, you prepare your team for incoming danger. You gain the Steel Yourselves! envoy directive.</p><h2>Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 damage if you're a master, and 4 damage if you're legendary.</p><h2>Envoy Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2><p>You've come a long way, and your hands-on experience has improved your skills. Your proficiency rank for your envoy class DC increases to expert.</p><h2>Hidden Agenda <span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2><p>You've become an expert at veiling your schemes. When a creature rolls a critical success at a Perception check to Sense Motive against you, or a skill check to Gather Information or Recall Knowledge about your secrets, they get a success instead. When you roll a critical failure at a saving throw against an effect or ability that would read or reveal your thoughts, emotions, or intentions, magically or otherwise, you get a failure instead.</p><h2>Perception Mastery <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>Through your adventures, you've developed keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank in Perception increases to master.</p><h2>Resolve <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>You've strengthened your mind with an inner reservoir of determination. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p><h2>Savvy Influencer <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>You can use Practiced Influencer twice per day. Additionally, the first time per day when you roll a natural 1 on a Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation check, you don't automatically reduce your degree of success (you get a critical failure only if your result is 10 lower than the DC).</p><h2>Effortless Influencer <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>The frequency of Practiced Influencer increases to three times per day. Furthermore, when you succeed at a check with Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation, allies within 60 feet who witnessed your success gain a +1 status bonus to the next check they attempt with that skill within 1 minute (or a +2 bonus if your check was a critical success).</p><h2>Light Armor Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>You've learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p><h2>Tactician <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>You know your allies' abilities well, and you can motivate them to leverage their strengths at a key moment. During your daily preparations, review your team's capabilities with up to five allies. You and each of these allies decide whether each is an attacker, defender, expert, or spellcaster for purposes of this ability. Later, you can issue the following directive.</p><h2>Weapon Mastery <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>You know your weapons like you know yourself. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p><h2>Greater Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p><h2>Legendary Improvisation <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>Your improvisation skills have dramatically improved. Improvised Mastery triggers on skill checks using a skill that you don't have legendary proficiency in, rather than master proficiency, and it grants you legendary proficiency for the triggering check, rather than master proficiency.</p><h2>Reflex Mastery <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p><h2>Greater Resolve <span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2><p>Your ambition and stubbornness grant you mental resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to legendary. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead. When you roll a critical failure on a Will save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Will save against a damaging effect, you take half damage.</p><h2>Incredible Senses <span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2><p>You notice things that are almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p><h2>Indiscernible Agenda <span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2><p>It's nigh impossible for your enemies to learn about your schemes or penetrate your long-term plans. When a creature rolls a critical success or success at a Perception check to Sense Motive against you, or on a skill check to Gather Information or Recall Knowledge about your secrets, they get a failure instead. When you roll a critical failure or failure at a saving throw against an effect or ability that would read or reveal your thoughts, emotions, or intentions, you get a success instead.</p><h2>Light Armor Mastery <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>Your skill with light armor improves, increasing your ability to dodge blows. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to master.</p><h2>Silver Tongue <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>Your savvy and skill are unparalleled. Select Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation. That skill's proficiency rank and your leadership skill increase to legendary. If that skill was already legendary, you can reroll that skill check once per day and take the higher result. This reroll is a fortune effect. Your proficiency rank for your envoy class DC increases to master.</p>"

If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p><h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2><p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2>Connection</h2><p>All mystics have a supernatural connection with a cosmic force that grants magical powers. The exact nature of your connection can vary widely—you might worship a god or pantheon, embody a metaphysical concept, commune with the souls of your ancestors, or something else—and even mystics who share the same connection may interpret it differently. Your connection determines the type of spells you cast and the spell tradition you choose spells from them, the epiphanies you learn, your additional trained skill, and a harmony that usually grants creatures a special benefit when you heal them with your vitality network.</p><h2>Initial Epiphany</h2><p>You discover the most basic truth of your connection. You learn your connection's initial epiphany focus spell. Epiphany spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to perform, spend time with your bonded allies, or otherwise ponder the nature of your connection. Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p><h2>Mystic Bond</h2><p>You use your connection to form a bond between yourself and others, mosty typically your closest companions or those you'll be working with for a prolonged period of time. Forming bonds is different for every mystic, but always involves using a 10-minute activity related to the mystic's connection that requires you to be adjacent to the creature with whom you wish to form. You can maintain a bond with up to 10 other willing creatures and the bond lasts until you or the bonded creature are no longer willing to be part of the bond. You are always considered part of your own bond and do not count toward the 10-creature limit.</p><p>You always knows the general distance and direction toward other bonded creatures, and if they are conscious, unconscious, dying or dead. This ability doesn't work across planes (including when in transit in the Drift), and some special magical or technological effects might intefere with your ability to detect your allies.</p><h2>Vitality Network</h2><p>Your soul supports a network of magical energy that connects and heals those in your bond. Your vitality network has a maximum capacity equal to 6 + 4 Hit Points per mystic level. You gain the Transfer Vitality action that you can use to take Hit Points out of your network and into yourself or your allies as healing.</p><p>Life or death situations help strengthen your bonds with your allies. At the start of each turn in combat, when you regain actions, your vitality network regains 4 Hit Points; if you are master in your connection skill, it regains 6 Hit Points instead; if you are legendary, it regains 8 Hit Points. Your vitality network regains an amount of Hit Points equal to double your level plus your Wisdom modifier when you use the Refocus action.</p><h2>Mystic Spellcasting</h2><p>You are a spellcaster and can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity (see Casting Spells). As a mystic, when you cast spells, you might intone a prayer or hum a song inspired by your epiphanies, you might gesture or dance in patterns that follow the flow of your connection's network, and you might accompany your spellcasting with wisps of energy flowing between you and your bonded allies.</p><p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a mystic, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the Mystic Spells per Day table.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Wisdom, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Wisdom modifier.</p><h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks. The signature spells class feature lets you heighten certain spells freely.</p><h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of mystic spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level mystic, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level mystic, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The trancendence class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Spell Repertoire</h2><p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your connection. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your connection, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p><p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot, you add a spell of the same rank to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new rank of spells, your first new spell is always the spell granted by your connection, but you can choose the other spells. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your connection and two other 2ndrank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might select a higher-rank version of a spell you already know so that you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p><p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p><h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3><p>As you gain new spells in your spell repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out bloodline spells. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p><h2>Mystic Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level, you gain a mystic class feat.</p><h2>Skill Feats</h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2>General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2>Group Chat <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>Those bonded by your mystic connection can always communicate telepathically while visible to one another. As long as two bonded creatures are on the same plane of existence and both are alive, they remain aware of one another's present state, general direction and distance from one another, and if they are conscious, unconscious, dying or dead. You also gain the Force Connection action.</p><h2>Reflex Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>You've honed your ability to dodge dangers and more easily move around the battlefield without taking damage from area attacks. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Signature Spells <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly, granting you extra control over your spellcasting. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher level than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p><h2>Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use an increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2>Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. The list of ancestry feats available to you can be found in your ancestry's entry.</p><h2>Fortitude Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>Your physique is incredibly hardy. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Advanced Epiphany <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>You understand your connection on a deeper level. You learn your connection's advanced epiphany focus spell.</p><h2>Expert Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>You have formed a more powerful bond with your connection. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics increase to expert.</p><h2>Resilient Soul <span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2><p>The links to your connection and your bonded companions bolster your soul against doubt. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p><h2>Greater Epiphany <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>Your soul aligns more perfectly with your connection. You learn your connection's greater epiphany focus spell.</p><h2>Weapon Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>You defeat your foes with the power of friendship and overwhelming firepower. Your proficiency rank for simple weapons and unarmed attacks increases to expert.</p><h2>Armor Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>The bond you've forged with your friends is an unbreakable shield you've learned to defend with your life. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p><h2>Master Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>You command powerful magic channeled through your connection. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to master.</p><h2>Legendary Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>Magic flows through your every pore. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary.</p><h2>Perfect Harmony <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You discover the ultimate truth of your connection and how it comprises the foundation of the cosmos. You learn your connection's perfect harmony.</p><h2>Transcendence <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You're a true conduit of your connection and manifest your transcendence with powerful spells. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using mystic spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10thrank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the Transcended Existence feat to gain a second slot.</p>"

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and you must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p><h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2><p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2>Stellar Attunement</h2><p>As a solarian, your existence cycles between the aspects of stars. You begin with two aspects: photon (the power of stars to emit heat, light, and plasma) or graviton (the power of stars to attract and imprison objects through gravity). At any time, you are considered graviton-attuned, photon-attuned, or unattuned. Many of your abilities have additional effects based on your current attunement, and some abilities swap your current state of attunement to another state.</p><p>Your default state of attunement is dictated by the favored attunement of your selected stellar arrangement. In encounter mode, you can use the Attune action to re-attune to your favored state. In exploration mode, you can take the Attunement Control activity to ensure that you are in constant control of what state of attunement you begin combat in, regardless of your favored attunement.</p><h2>Solar Manifestations</h2><p>Your deep understanding of the stellar forces of the universe manifests in a variety of tangible ways. You can create and maintain all three different manifestations: solar flare, a solar nimbus, and a solar weapon. Your manifestations temporarily vanish if you become unattuned.</p><h2>Solarian Arrangement</h2><p>As adherents of the cycle of creation and destruction, solarians maintain strong personal beliefs that attach themselves to specific aspects of the cycle. At 1st level, your arrangement grants you a favored attunement, which determines your starting attunement state in combat (unless you've used the Attunement Control exploration action) and what state the Attune action attunes you to. It also provides you with an initial revelation, and proficiency with a particular skill. You also gain advanced and greater revelations at later levels.</p><h2>Solarian Feats</h2><p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a solarian class feat.</p><h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2>General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2>Indomitable Body and Mind <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>Through meditation and perseverance, you've gained a broader control of your body. Your proficiency rank in Fortitude saves increases to expert. When you roll a success at a Fortitude or Will save against a mental or incapacitation effect, you can choose to change your current attunement.</p><h2>Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2>Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p><h2>Solarion Weapon Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>You unlock further understanding of the many weapons of the cosmos. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects for your solar weapon.</p><h2>Pensive Assessor <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Your careful training and honed senses give you increased awareness of your surroundings. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks for initiative, making you faster to react during combat. This bonus increases to +3 if you have the Incredible Initiative general feat.</p><h2>Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you've practiced with most. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p><h2>Willful Defiance <span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2><p>Your meditative practices steel you against mental intrusions. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save against a mental or incapacitation effect, you get a critical success instead.</p><h2>Armor Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>You have spent so much time in armor that you know how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor specialization effects of light and medium armor.</p><h2>Solarion Weapon Mastery <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>Your weapon becomes and extension of yourself. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons and unarmed attacks increases to master. Your proficiency rank for your solarian class DC increases to expert.</p><h2>Controlled Body <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>You instinctively react to sudden danger by manipulating subtle gravitational forces to get out of harm's way. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p><h2>Greater Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p><h2>Armor Mastery <span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2><p>You are able to deftly protect yourself in almost any situation. Your proficiency ranks for light, and medium armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.</p><h2>Solar Paradigm <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>Your proficiency rank for your solar weapon increases to legendary. Your proficiency rank for your solarian class DC increases to master.</p>"

At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different attribute modifiers. If an attribute modifier is already +4 or higher, it takes two boosts to increase it; you get a partial boost, and you must boost that attribute again at a later level to increase it by 1.</p><h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2><p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p><h2>Suppressing Fire</h2><p>You have a knack for using powerful weapons to hinder your foes and prevent them from operating at their peak. If you make an attack with a weapon that has the area trait (such as from the Area Fire or Auto-Fire actions), you use it in a manner that suppresses your targets. Enemies in the affected area who fail their save against your attack become suppressed until the start of your next turn. A suppressed target takes a –1 circumstance penalty on attack rolls and takes a –10-foot status penalty to its Speeds. Some Soldier abilities and class feats interact further with the suppressed condition.</p><h2>Primary Target</h2><p>You can pick out a single target to bring down greater fire on when unleashing the full devastation of your powerful area weaponry. When you make an attack with an area of effect weapon (such as from the Area Fire or Auto-Fire actions), you can choose a single creature either adjacent to the center point of the attack or the closest to you within a cone or line to be your primary target. After resolving the area of effect attack, make a ranged Strike using your weapon against the selected target. Ignore the unwieldy trait on your weapon when using this action. This follow-up Strike consumes an amount of ammo from the weapon equal to its expend, and you can't make this additional Strike if you don't have sufficient ammo. If two or more creatures are equidistant or closest, you can choose which one is your primary target. If you successfully hit your primary target with this Strike, then that target is suppressed until the start of your next turn. This Strike uses the same multiple attack penalty as your Area Fire or Auto-Fire action but doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.</p><h2>Soldier Fighting Styles</h2><p>As a soldier, you applied yourself to a specific style of combat. Your style determines how you tend to approach combat and often changes how you take advantage of your ability to suppress targets. Choose a soldier fighting style.</p><h2>Walking Armory</h2><p>You wield heavy equipment and can carry it. When determining your Strength for using armor, you can instead choose to use your Constitution modifier. If you already meet the Strength requirement for the armor you're wearing, reduce that armor's Bulk by 1 (to a minimum of 1). In addition, increase the amount of Bulk you can carry before becoming encumbered by half your Constitution modifier rounded up. Increase your maximum carried Bulk by your Constitution modifier.</p><h2>Soldier Feats</h2><p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain a soldier class feat.</p><h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2>Fearsome Bulwark <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>Your sheer mass terrifies foes when they see you. You can use your Constitution modifier instead of your Charisma modifier on Intimidation checks, and instead of your Strength modifier on Athletics checks to Reposition or Shove.</p><h2>Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2>General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2>Reflex Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>Your reactionary defenses grow stronger. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to the initial ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p><h2>Perception Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>You remain alert to threats around you and can react a moment's notice. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p><h2>Soldier Weapon Expert <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>You've learned how to use your weapons in a way that pulverizes your foes and makes the best use of your area attacks. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons and martial weapons increases to expert. You gain access to the critical specialization effects for weapons with the area or automatic traits.</p><h2>Armor Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor specialization effects for medium and heavy armor.</p><h2>Soldier Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Your ability to unleash area of effect attacks and utilize your equipment improves. Your proficiency rank for your soldier class DC increases to expert.</p><h2>Tough as Nails <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p><h2>Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p><h2>Soldier's Resolution <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p><h2>Armor Mastery <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.</p><h2>Soldier Mastery <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>Through skill and dedication, you've mastered devastating weapons. Your proficiency rank for your soldier class DC increases to master. Your proficiency ranks for unarmed attacks, simple weapons, and martial weapons increase to master.</p><h2>Unshakable Juggernaut <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Fortitude save, you get a failure instead. When you fail a Fortitude save against an effect that deals damage, you halve the damage you take.</p><h2>Legendary Armor <span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2><p>Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to legendary.</p><h2>Legendary Soldier <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>Your actions are the stuff of legends, and your skill with controlling your weapons is unmatched.

This might manifest as a haze in the air that shows shimmers of alternate realities or appear as walls of glowing magical equations only you can understand. The effects of your quantum field are determined by your paradox. You can further enhance and manipulate your quantum field through your witchwarper feat selections and by casting warp spells. You can activate or extend the duration of your quantum field by using reality-warping magic.</p><p>You have the Warp Reality action, which lets you activate your quantum field. This action gains the arcane or occult trait based on the tradition of your selected paradox.</p><h2>Witchwarper Spellcasting</h2><p>Your paradox grants you magical power. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity. As a witchwarper, when you cast spells, you might describe your revelations about other realities aloud, accompanied by elegant gestures while arcane equations or occult symbols blaze around you.</p><p>Each day, you can cast up to three 1st-rank spells. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.</p><p>As you increase in level as a witchwarper, your number of spells per day increases, as does the highest rank of spells you can cast, as shown on the table below.</p><p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key attribute is Intelligence, your spell attack modifiers and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p><h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3><p>When you get spell slots of 2nd rank and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-rank spells. This increases the spell's rank, heightening it to match the spell slot. You must have a spell in your spell repertoire at the rank you want to cast in order to heighten it to that rank. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain ranks.</p><h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3><p>Some of your spells are cantrips. A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest rank of witchwarper spell slot you have. For example, as a 1st-level witchwarper, your cantrips are 1st-rank spells, and as a 5th-level witchwarper, your cantrips are 3rd-rank spells.</p><h3><strong>Warp Spells</strong></h3><p>You can create bizarre and powerful magical phenomena known as warp spells. You learn your initial warp spell. These visual flourishes might include floating equations, visions of alternate realities with distinct properties, or subtle alterations as reality warps around you. Warp spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a warp spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to contemplate infinite worlds or conduct quantum magical research.</p><p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.</p><p>Warp spells have the anchoring trait, unlike other focus spells. This trait means you can only use warp spells while your quantum field is activated, and you can choose to sustain your quantum field when you cast warp spells.</p><p>You learn warps based your paradox.</p><table class=\"pf2e\"><thead><tr><th>Your Level</th><th>Cantrips</th><th>1st</th><th>2nd</th><th>3rd</th><th>4th</th><th>5th</th><th>6th</th><th>7th</th><th>8th</th><th>9th</th><th>10th</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>1*</td></tr><tr><td style=\"color:white;width:120px;background-color:#522e2c;text-align:center;height:25px\" colspan=\"12\">* The Quantum Thesis class feature gives you a 10th-rank spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Spell Repertoire</h2><p>The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-rank spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your paradox. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your paradox. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell rank.</p><p>You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot (see Witchwarper Spells per Day), you add a spell to your spell repertoire of the same rank. At 2nd level, select another 1st-rank spell; at 3rd level, you gain a new spell from your paradox and two other 2ndrank spells, and so on. When you add spells, you might add a higher-rank version of a spell you already have, so you can cast a heightened version of that spell.</p><p>Though you gain them at the same rate, your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it wouldn't give you another spell slot, and vice versa.</p><h3><strong>Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire</strong></h3><p>As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same rank. This spell can be a cantrip, but you can't swap out spells gained from your paradox. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.</p><h2>Skill Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a skill feat. Skill feats can be found in Chapter 5 and have the skill trait. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p><h2>Witchwarper Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 2</span></h2><p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a witchwarper class feat.</p><h2>Anchoring Spells <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>You become more familiar with magic you practice regularly, drawing on those spells as another anchor to reality. When you are inside or adjacent to your quantum field and cast a signature spell, the spell gains the anchoring trait.</p><h2>General Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p><h2>Signature Spells <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>You've learned to cast some of your spells more flexibly. For each spell rank you have access to, choose one spell of that rank to be a signature spell. You don't need to learn heightened versions of signature spells separately; instead, you can heighten these spells freely. If you've learned a signature spell at a higher rank than its minimum, you can also cast all its lower-rank versions without learning those separately. If you swap out a signature spell, you can choose a replacement signature spell of the same spell rank at which you learned the previous spell. You can also retrain specifically to change a signature spell to a different spell of that rank without swapping any spells; this takes as much time as retraining a spell normally does.</p><h2>Skill Increases <span style=\"float:right\">Level 3</span></h2><p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p><p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p><h2>Ancestry Feats <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p><h2>Reflex Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 5</span></h2><p>Your awareness of possible dangers, through incredible analysis or an understanding of the wider multiverse, increases your reflexes. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Advanced Paradox <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Through further experimentation and research, you have discovered secrets of your paradox and unlocked new abilities. You gain the advanced warp spell associated with your paradox.</p><h2>Expert Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 7</span></h2><p>Extended practice of magic has improved your capabilities. Your proficiency ranks for class DC, spell attack modifier, and spell DC increase to expert.</p><h2>Magical Fortitude <span style=\"float:right\">Level 9</span></h2><p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p><h2>Greater Paradox <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>Further research into your paradox has uncovered greater secrets. You gain the greater warp spell associated with your paradox.</p><h2>Perception Expertise <span style=\"float:right\">Level 11</span></h2><p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p><h2>Defensive Aura <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>The flow of magic through your spellcasting and your defensive training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency ranks in light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p><h2>Weapon Specialization <span style=\"float:right\">Level 13</span></h2><p>You inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master and 4 if you're legendary.</p><h2>Master Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 15</span></h2><p>Your spells are among the most potent across all possible worlds. Your proficiency ranks for class DC, spell attack modifier, and spell DC increase to master.</p><h2>Transcendent Will <span style=\"float:right\">Level 17</span></h2><p>The intense experiences you've accumulated through your studies or travels have strengthened your mental fortitude. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save you get a critical success instead.</p><h2>Legendary Spellcaster <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You push past the boundaries of magical theory to embody the pinnacle of spellcasting. Your proficiency ranks for spell attack modifier and spell DC increase to legendary.</p><h2>Quantum Thesis <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You command the most potent magic and can cast spells of truly incredible power. Add two common 10th-rank spells of your tradition to your repertoire. You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using witchwarper spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, and they can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the Quantum Research witchwarper feat to gain a second slot.</p><h2>Warped Infinities <span style=\"float:right\">Level 19</span></h2><p>You have mastered reality and can make it your plaything. The radius of your quantum field becomes 100 feet. When you activate or Sustain your quantum field, you can modify the area of its effect by excluding any number of squares.</p>"
