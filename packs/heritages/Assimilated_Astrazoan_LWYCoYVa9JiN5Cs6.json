Choose a common ancestry. You can select ancestry feats from the ancestry you chose, in addition to your character's own ancestry. You can select feats that require a physiological feature that you lack but can only benefit from those feats while you are in that ancestry's form; for example, an assimilated astrazoan who selects the shirren @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.feats.Item.fAVZRiRNde07YcbG]{Basic Insectile Flight} feat can only fly while in their shirren form.</p>",
