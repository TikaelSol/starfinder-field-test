The number of days you can go without food or water before you take damage from thirst or starvation is increased by 2 (to a number of days equal to 3 + your Constitution modifier). You gain a +1 circumstance bonus on Society and Survival checks to Subsist, and a +1 circumstance bonus on saving throws against gaining the sickened condition and to remove the sickened condition.</p>"
