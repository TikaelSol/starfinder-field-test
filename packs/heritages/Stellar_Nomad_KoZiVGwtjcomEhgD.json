During your daily preparations, you can study a particular faction, philosophy, ancestry, or religion to learn one of their edicts or anathemas and gain a broader understanding of that culture's customs and traditions. While you follow that edict or anathema, you become trained in the associated lore (such as Vesk Lore or Damoritosh Lore). This proficiency lasts until you prepare again. Since this training is temporary, you can't use it as a prerequisite for a permanent character option like a feat or a skill increase.</p>"
