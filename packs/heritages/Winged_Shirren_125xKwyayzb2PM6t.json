When Leaping horizontally, you move an additional 5 feet. You don't automatically fail your checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.2HJ4yuEFY1Cast4h]{High Jump} or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.JUvAvruz7yRQXfz2]{Long Jump} if you don't Stride at least 10 feet first. In addition, when you perform a Long Jump, you can jump a distance up to 10 feet further than the result of your Athletics check (within the normal maximum for your Speed). As long as you can act, you take no damage from falling, regardless of the distance you fall.</p>"
