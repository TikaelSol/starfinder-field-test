You may come from a long line of mystics, be born at a holy site on Pulonis, or simply have reached out in fervent prayer at a time of crisis. Most of Meyel's chosen can point to at least one past event when their goddess may have intervened to save them from death or some other awful fate. Whether metaphorically or literally, you always seem to land on your feet. The first time each day that you critically fail a saving throw, you immediately reroll the saving throw as a free action; this is a fortune effect.</p>"
