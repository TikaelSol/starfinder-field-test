Your size is Small instead of Medium. You ignore difficult terrain and uneven ground caused by sand. In addition, environmental heat effects are one step less extreme for you (incredible heat becomes extreme, extreme heat becomes severe, and so on), and you can go 10 times as long as normal before you are affected by starvation or thirst.</p>"
