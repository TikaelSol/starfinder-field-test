All other creatures must use the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} action to attempt a Perception check against your Deception DC to determine which creature is real and which is an imitation. A creature who doesn't know which creature you are must succeed at a @Check[flat|dc:11] when targeting either of you with an attack, spell, or other effect. If the check fails, the attack, spell, or effect targets the other creature instead.</p><p>Abilities such as telepathy or the mystic's group chat feature may automatically allow a creature to determine which creature is which, but an aware creature must still use the Point Out action to indicate to others which creature is which. An imitated creature might have a signal or phrase that indicates to their allies which creature is which, but doing so in the din of battle is an action with the auditory or visual trait.</p>",
