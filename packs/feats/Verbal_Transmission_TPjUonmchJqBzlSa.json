For example, your voice could emit audibly from an intercom or appear as text on a vidscreen or holosign. Select an unsecured technological device within 100 feet. For 1 minute, you can choose to transmit anything you say through that output device, rather than say it aloud. You can change which device you use as an output as a single action. Doing so doesn't extend the duration.</p>"
