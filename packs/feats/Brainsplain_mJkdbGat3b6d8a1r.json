For inexplicable reasons, doing so tends to aggravate the creature rather than educate it. The creature must attempt a @Check[will|against:class] save against your class DC. If you critically succeeded at the triggering check to Recall Knowledge, the target takes a â€“1 status penalty to its Will save. The creature is then temporarily immune for 24 hours.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You accidentally overshare, exposing your own foibles. The creature gains a +1 circumstance bonus to its next attack roll against you, as long as that attack is made within 1 minute.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 1} for [[/gmr 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.e1XGnhKNSQIm5IXg]{Stupefied 2} for 1 round, after which it is stupefied 1 for [[/gmr 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds}.</p>",
