Make an @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.actions.Item.oc0ZKnk5zD0GXqZi]{Area Fire} with your weapon. You can choose one solid surface within the line's range to ricochet your shot off, continuing the line for the remainder of its distance in one direction of your choice. When determining if a target has cover from your attack, determine the target's cover from the point where you ricochet your shot from instead of you. A creature that is in the same line's attack more than once doesn't take any additional damage.</p>"
