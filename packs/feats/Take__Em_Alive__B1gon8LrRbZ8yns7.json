You and your allies don't take the normal â€“2 circumstance penalty when making a nonlethal attack with a weapon that doesn't have the nonlethal trait. When you or an ally Cast a Spell that deals damage and doesn't have the death or void trait, you can add the nonlethal trait to the spell.</p><p><strong>Lead by Example</strong> If you make a nonlethal attack against a single target before the end of your turn, you direct your allies to take down a specific target for later follow-up. The target of your attack is treated as having your @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.actions.Item.FXlhxST6fuaFt3Nh]{Get 'Em!} directive on them, though you don't benefit from the lead by example effect on the Get 'Em!</p>"
