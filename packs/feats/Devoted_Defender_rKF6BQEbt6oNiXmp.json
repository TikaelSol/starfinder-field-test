Whenever you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.xjGwis0uaC2305pm]{Raise a Shield} or position a weapon with the parry trait defensively to increase your AC, you can select one adjacent ally. As long as the selected ally remains adjacent to you, they gain the same circumstance bonus to AC from your shield or weapon as you do. These benefits last until the start of your next turn. If you have the Shield Block feat, during this time you can trigger Shield Block when you have your shield raised and the selected ally would take damage from a physical attack, in addition to Shield Block's usual trigger.</p>"
