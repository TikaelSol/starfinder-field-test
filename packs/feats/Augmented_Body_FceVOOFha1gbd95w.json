This augmentation does not count against your total implant limit. The first time you take this feat, the augmentation you receive is free as long as it's item level is 1 or lower. You can upgrade this augmentation by swapping it out with another augmentation when you gain a level or by spending downtime replacing the augmentation as though changing out a feat. When you swap out the augmentation, you must pay the difference between the original and new augmentation each time you upgrade.</p>"
