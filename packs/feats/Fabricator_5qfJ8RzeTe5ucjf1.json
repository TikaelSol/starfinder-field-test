      "value": "<p>You know how to configure and print items out of UPBs in creator capsules. You use technology to more efficiently and quickly produce technological item that you might need by employing effective 3D-printing tools. You must have the formula to create an item in a creator capsule and pay an amount of UPBs equal to the material price of the item. You Craft the item using a Computers check instead of a Crafting check, multiplying the result of the appropriate Computers or Crafting check by the rank of the crafting capsule (for example, a tactical creator capsule multiplies the result by 2).</p>\n<p>Unlike normal Crafting, this process takes 1 hour instead of 4 days, but on a critical failure you ruin 50% of the raw materials used so far, instead of 10%. When you select this feat, you gain formulas for four common tech items of 2nd level of lower.</p>\n<p>You cannot use this ability to create magical equipment unless you have @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.xWY5omyIcILNR7y1]{Magical Crafting}. If you have Magical Crafting, then you can also use this feat to use Computers to construct magitech items that have the Tech and Magical traits.</p>"
