You can use the body of a technological creature to help Craft items, expending it toward the item's raw material cost as well. (The GM makes the determination if the creature's entry doesn't list any valuable materials from its body.) If the creature or one of the creature's abilities, including spells, uses a trait shared by the item you're Crafting, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your check. If you spend additional days working on the item, reduce the price using the creature's level instead of your own. Certain items may require specific creatures in their Craft requirement.</p>"
