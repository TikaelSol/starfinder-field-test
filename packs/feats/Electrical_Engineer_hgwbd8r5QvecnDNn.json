If the source of power is a technological creature or hazard, it must have been destroyed within the last 10 minutes and provides charges equal to twice its level. If the source is a facility capable of charging a battery, it operates as if the battery were always fully charged. If you are a master in Crafting, you can connect a device to a power source as a 3-action activity. If you're legendary, it takes 1 action.</p>"
