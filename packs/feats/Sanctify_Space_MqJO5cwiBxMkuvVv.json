      "value": "<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You have a religious symbol of a deity.</p>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You dedicate a 30-foot area to a deity by using the deity's religious symbol and saying a 10-minute prayer. If you are legendary in Religion, you can dedicate a 60-foot area. Until the next time you make daily preparations, all creatures in the area who follow the deity's edicts gain a +1 status bonus to AC, attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws against any creatures who violate the deity's anathema in the area. Once a creature violates the deity's anathema within the sanctified space, they are susceptible to this effect, even if they leave the area and return. Likewise, once a creature fails to uphold the deity's edicts while within the sanctified space, it no longer receives this bonus, even if it leaves the area and returns. Creatures who are in egregiously negative standing with a deity may not use this feat to sanctify a space for that deity, and subject to the GM's discretion, may violate that deity's anathema simply by being in a sanctified space.</p>"
