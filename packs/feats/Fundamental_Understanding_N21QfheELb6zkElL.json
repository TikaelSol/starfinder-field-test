You must be aware of the casting.</p><hr /><p>As long as you are trained in the appropriate skill for the spell's tradition and it's a common spell, you automatically identify the spell being cast (you still roll to attempt to get a critical success, but can't get a worse result than a success). You or a visible ally within 60 feet targeted by this spell gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your saving throw or your AC against it (or a +2 if you rolled a critical success).</p>"
