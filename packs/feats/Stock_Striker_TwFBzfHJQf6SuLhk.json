Any two-handed firearm you wield gains the parry trait and can be used as a two-handed melee weapon to make a stock attack that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage, is in the brawling group, and has the analog trait. If the firearm is above commercial grade, the stock gains the same additional damage dice and tracking benefits as the firearm, but does not benefit from upgrades installed in the firearm.</p>"
