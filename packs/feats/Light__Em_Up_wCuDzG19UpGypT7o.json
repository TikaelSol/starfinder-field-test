      "value": "<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are wielding a weapon with the area or automatic trait.</p><hr /><p>Your opponents can run, but they can't hide! You spray your area weapon in the general direction of an unseen enemy, revealing its location. Make an @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.actions.Item.6ctkxUnVwqooSvgg]{Auto-Fire} or @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.actions.Item.oc0ZKnk5zD0GXqZi]{Area Fire} attack. If the primary target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed}, you don't need to attempt a flat check to target it, and if it's @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.iU0fEDdBp3rXpTMC]{Hidden}, the DC of the flat check to target it is 5. When you suppress a concealed creature with this attack, the debris around it helps reveal its current position and no flat check is needed to target it; If it is hidden, the DC of the flat check to target it becomes 5 and the creature can't become undetected. This benefit lasts as long as the creature remains @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppressed}.</p>"
