Roll a check with your connection skill against the target's Will DC. The target is them temporarily immune for 1 hour.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The flash of insight imposes a –1 status penalty to attack rolls and a –3 status penalty to Will saves on the target for 1 minute. This effect ends early if it uses a single action with the concentrate trait to shake off the effects of the interference or immediately after you target the creature with a hostile action.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the penalty to Will saves is –2.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The brief connection causes you to lower your guard. You become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} against the next attack the target attempts against you before the end of your next turn.</p>"
