On a failure, the foes are pulled directly towards you, ending in an adjacent square if possible. You select the order which foes are moved.</p><p><strong>Photon-Attuned</strong> The squares you moved through during your stride are suffused with solar energy until the start of your next turn. Creatures on each side of the squares are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} from creatures on the opposite side. Creatures in these spaces are unaffected.</p>"
