Your weapon gains the area (burst 5 feet) and unwieldy traits until the end of the turn. If your weapon has reach, the burst radius becomes the reach of your weapon. Make an attack using @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.actions.Item.oc0ZKnk5zD0GXqZi]{Area Fire}, with the burst centered on a corner of your square. You are excluded from the burst. Targets in range take damage as though struck with a melee Strike you make with your weapon, but they must succeed at a basic Reflex save as normal. If you're using a weapon with the backswing or sweep trait, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the save DC of the attack.</p><p>If you have the @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.class-features.Item.8J94LU3sVZv12P2e]{Primary Target} class feature, the follow-up Strike to a Whirling Swipe is a melee Strike.</p>"
