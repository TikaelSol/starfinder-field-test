      "value": "<p>Retractable barriers extend from your drone or turret exocortex to create a temporary wall. You either create a 5-foot-wide metal wall in a space adjacent to your drone or turret, or you extend a wall you've already created by 5 additional feet. The walls created by your exocortex are 1 inch thick, 5 feet high, and are placed vertically on the border between squares. They must be placed on a solid, horizontal surface. The walls are a part of your exocortex, sharing the same statistics and Hit Points. </p><p>These walls automatically retract back into your exocortex if the drone or turret that created the walls moves (or is forced to move) from its location.</p>",
