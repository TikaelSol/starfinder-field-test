Attempt a @Check[type:nature] check against a DC determined by the GM; this is usually the animal's Will DC, but circumstances might adjust the precise DC. On a success, you communicate basic information to the animal, such as the direction of prey or where something might be buried. On a critical failure, the creature refuses to communicate with you for 24 hours and may become hostile if it isn't already accustomed to you.</p>"
