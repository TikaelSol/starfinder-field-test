      "value": "<p>You take in your surroundings, instantly opening your mind up to the answers hidden all around you and the clues their presence has left behind. You instantly use up to three Recall Knowledge actions. If you have any special abilities or free actions that would normally be triggered when you Recall Knowledge, you can't use them for these actions. The first time one of these attempts to Recall Knowledge uses a Lore skill you selected with Additional Lore, you roll the associated Recall Knowledge check twice and use the higher result. That Recall Knowledge check gains the fortune trait.</p>",
