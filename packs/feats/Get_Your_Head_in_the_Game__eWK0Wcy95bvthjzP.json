The target suppresses the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.HL2l2VRSaQHu9lUw]{Fatigued} condition for [[/r 1d4 #rounds]]{1d4 rounds} and loses the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} condition. If the target is off-guard due to a continual effect and would immediately regain the off-guard condition, such as when Balancing on a narrow surface or in zero-gravity, you instead suppress that instance of the off-guard condition for the same number of rounds that you suppress the fatigued condition. This does not prevent the target from gaining the off-guard condition in other ways. The target then becomes immune to Get Your Head in the Game! for 1 hour.</p>"
