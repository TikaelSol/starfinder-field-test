You're constantly under the effects of @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.BBvV7qoXGdw09q1C]{Speak With Animals} and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.qvwIwJ9QBihy8R0t]{Speak With Plants} while on your planet. You are considered a native of any planet in your bond. Creatures native to your planet feel an instinctual connection to you, granting a +2 to Diplomacy checks when making a @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.DCb62iCBrJXy0Ik6]{Request} from them. Particularly helpful creatures may agree to minor tasks like delivering messages or spying on an area, but they won't do dangerous jobs or fight for you.</p><p>You vow to protect your bonded world. Gain the following edicts and anathemas.</p><p><strong>Edicts</strong> defend your world from extraterrestrial threats, protect its natural resources from exploitation, form bonds with lifeforms on your planet</p><p><strong>Anathemas</strong> disturb or harm your planet's ecosystem, plunder your planet's natural resources, exploit your planet's lifeforms</p><p>If your powers are lost due to anathema, you lose the effects of this feat and cannot bond with another planet only if you repent by conducting an @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.7Fd4lxozd11MQ55N]{Atone} ritual.</p>",
