      "value": "<p>Reaching across space, you connect with the River Between and seize a fragment of its solar stream, inundating the battlefield in golden light and solar energy. This trickle of the River Between fills a @Template[type:line|distance:100] that is 10 feet in diameter, starts from your square, and remains for 1 minute. Once the river forms, you can move to any square within the river (this movement does not trigger reactions). The area is bright light and counts as a vacuum for the purposes of a sarcesian using their energy wings. Non-sarcesians in the area when you use Ride the River Between, or who later enter the area, must succeed at a <code>@Check[fortitude|against:class-spell] </code>save or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.TkIyaNPgTZFBCCuh]{Dazzled} for 1 round (1 minute on a critical failure). Creatures affected by this ability are temporarily immune for 24 hours. The DC of this save is equal to the higher of your spell DC or class DC.</p>",
