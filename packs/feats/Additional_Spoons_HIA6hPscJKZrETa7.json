Spend 10 minutes and attempt a @Check[type:diplomacy] check to reduce an ally's clumsy, enfeebled, or stupefied condition value by 1, or reduce it by 2 on a critical success. You can reduce only one condition at a time.</p><p>The DC for the Diplomacy check for this action is usually the DC of the effect that caused the condition or a level-appropriate DC based on GM discretion. Outside elements can influence this, and if a player has suffered a major traumatic event, they may require more dedicated counseling from a medical professional. A creature can only benefit from this action once every 24 hours.</p>"
