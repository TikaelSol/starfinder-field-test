You can Dismiss this effect. When you do, you emerge in a space adjacent to the target you were merged with. While combined, you and your target each take your own turns, as normal and must be targeted separately for purposes of abilities and other effects. Additionally, you and your target gain the following benefits.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the target is Medium or smaller, their size increases to Large and their reach increases to 10 feet.</li>\n<li>You occupy the target's space. If the target moves, you move with them, so that you always occupy their space. You can't take actions with the move trait.</li>\n<li>For each Speed you possess, compare it to that of your target. If your Speed is faster, or they lack that Speed, they gain your Speed.</li>\n<li>Your body shields the target from harm, granting them greater cover, though you do not gain cover. Your body doesn't obscure their vision or block line of sight.</li>\n</ul>"
