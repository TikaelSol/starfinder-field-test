Create two wormholes in unoccupied squares that are within 100 feet, visible to you, and at least 15 feet apart. If a creature enters the space of a wormhole, it emerges onto any adjacent space to the other wormhole that the creature desires. If there is no valid space for the creature to enter, then both wormholes collapse and the creature remains in the space where it entered the first wormhole. The wormholes last for 1 round before collapsing, but you can Sustain the wormholes for up to 1 minute. The attuned effects of this ability only apply to your attunement when you create the wormholes.</p><p><strong>Graviton-Attuned</strong> A creature beginning its turn adjacent to a wormhole must succeed at a @Check[type:fortitude|against:class] save against your class DC or be pulled into the wormhole.</p><p><strong>Photon-Attuned</strong> A creature entering the wormhole becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} until the start of its next turn.</p>"
