While sneaking, you ignore difficult terrain caused by foliage and underbrush and treat greater difficult terrain caused by foliage or underbrush as difficult terrain. In addition, you can move at your full swim Speed when you @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.VMozDqMMuK5kpoX4]{Sneak} while swimming. If you have another ability that allows you to move at full speed while Sneaking, you also gain a +2 status bonus to checks to Sneak while Swimming.</p>",
