In most cases, this is going to be an attempt made against a local computer system that you access directly or indirectly through the use of a hacking toolkit. Attempt a @Check[type:computers] check to determine if you can access the targeted system. Computers with improved systems might require multiple successes to access.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You access the system, or you achieve two successes toward accessing a system requiring more than one success. You leave no trace of your tampering.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> You access the system, or you achieve one success toward accessing a system that requires more than one success.</p><p><strong>Failure</strong> You fail to access the system or achieve any success toward accessing a system that requires more than one success. Some computerized systems might have security measures that activate on a failure.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You activate specially ingrained security protocols or completely lock yourself out of the system. Being locked out of a system prevents you from attempting another check to access it for the next hour.</p>"
