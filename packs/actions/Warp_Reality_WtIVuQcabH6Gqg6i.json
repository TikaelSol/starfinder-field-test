Your quantum field is a @Template[type:burst|distance:15]{15-foot-radius burst} centered on a point you choose within 100 feet. While your quantum field is active, you can use actions that have the anchoring trait. Your quantum field's other specific effects are determined by your paradox. You can choose whether creatures in the area are affected by your quantum field.</p><p>Your quantum field automatically deactivates if you're knocked out, you dismiss it, or if you move more than 100 feet away from it.</p>"
