Make a Strike with your solar weapon and a Solar Shot, each using your current multiple attack penalty and both at the same target. You can make these attacks in whichever order you desire. If an attack hits, resolve the damage and effects, then swap your current attunement. This counts as two attacks when calculating your multiple attack penalty. If both attacks fail to hit, you become unattuned.</p>"
