While this is most often used when traveling with a mech, vehicle, or starship, the same skill can be used to determine the optimal route to take while traveling on foot. This lets you plan a general heading on a planetoid or guide your starship on an in-system voyage. If you are navigating a short journey, you typically attempt a @Check[type:piloting] check only once per day, but some environments or changes might necessitate rolling more often. The GM determines the DC and how long this activity takes (usually just a minute or so). More unusual locales or those you're unfamiliar with might require you to have a minimum proficiency rank to Navigate.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You get an excellent sense of where you are. If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you know them exactly.</p><p><strong>Success</strong> You gain enough orientation to avoid becoming hopelessly lost. If you are in an environment with cardinal directions, you have a sense of those directions.</p>"
