Any creature dropped to 0 Hit Points by this effect is torn asunder and pulled into the singularity, leaving no remains. Until the end of your next turn, the singularity's space and all adjacent squares count as an area of supernatural darkness that no creatures (even those with greater darkvision) can see through. Creatures beginning their round within the area of the darkness must succeed a @Check[type:fortitude|dc:resolve(@actor.system.attributes.classDC.value)|basic:true] save against your class DC or become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.xYTAsEpcJE1Ccni3]{Slowed 1} for that round.</p><hr /><p><strong>Level (+2)</strong> increase the damage by 2d8.</p>"
