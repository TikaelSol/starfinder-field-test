After Casting a Spell, one item you hold, wield, or wear, or a tech minion you are commanding (depending on your programming language), becomes overclocked for 1 minute. You can only have one overclocked gear at a time; if you attempt to overclock a different piece of gear, any other gear you have overclocked is no longer overclocked. As long as your gear is overclocked, you gain the benefits of your programming language's overclock boost.</p>",
