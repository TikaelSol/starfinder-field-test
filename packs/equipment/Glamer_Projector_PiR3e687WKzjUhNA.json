This upgrade is capable only of changing the appearance of your armor, not yourself or the rest of your equipment. You can copy the look of any type of clothing, but you don't gain any item bonuses provided by special types of clothing such as luxury fashion attire. Only a creature that is benefiting from truesight or a similar effect can attempt to disbelieve this glamer, opposed by your class DC.</p>"
