Despite their myriad forms and functions, these stones are purportedly all fragments of crystal tools used by otherworldly entities to construct the universe in primeval times.</p><p>When you invest one of these precisely shaped crystals, the stone orbits your head (or another visible part of your anatomy if you don't have a head) instead of being worn on your body. You can stow an aeon stone with an Interact action, and an orbiting stone can be snatched out of the air with a successful @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.Dt6B1slsBy8ipJu9]{Disarm} action against you. A stowed or removed stone remains invested, but its effects are suppressed until you return it to orbit your head again.</p><p>There are various types of aeon stones, each with a different appearance and magical effect. Each aeon stone also gains a resonant power when slotted into specific items, such as weapons with the aeon trait or long-lost magical items called wayfinders.</p><p>This gold star glitters with joyful energy. The resonant power allows you to cast guidance as an occult innate cantrip.</p><p><strong>Activateâ€”Cosmic Luck</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">3</span> (concentrate)</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p><p><strong>Trigger</strong> You critically fail an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You change the critical failure into a failure.</p>"
