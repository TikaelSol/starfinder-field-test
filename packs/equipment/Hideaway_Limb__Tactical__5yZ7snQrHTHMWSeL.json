The compartment holds items of negligible Bulk and items of light Bulk that are small enough to fit in your limb or can otherwise be folded or contracted to fit. A hideaway in a leg (in a human) can typically hold more than one in an arm, and your size also adjusts the capacity at the GM's discretion.</p><p>When the compartment is closed, the seam in your limb is difficult to detect. You gain a +1 bonus to Stealth checks to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.qVNVSmsgpKFGk9hV]{Conceal an Object} in a hideaway limb. Though this compartment can foil a cursory pat down, many security checkpoints include a scan to detect such devices.</p><p><strong>Activate—Draw</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> (manipulate)</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> You Interact to draw an item @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.DmAIPqOBomZ7H95W]{Concealed} in your hideaway limb.</p><p>When you use Draw, if the item can be activated or otherwise used with a single action, you may use the item as part of the same action. For example, you Interact to draw a weapon, then Strike with that weapon.</p>"
