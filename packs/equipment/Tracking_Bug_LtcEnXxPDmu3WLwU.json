      "value": "<p>This tracking device contains a miniature transponder that helps you follow and locate your quarry. You can hide a tracking bug on a creature with a successful Thievery check to Palm an Object from the creature, but instead of taking an object, you leave the bug somewhere in the creature's possession, such as in their pocket. You can hide a tracking bug on a vehicle or other object with a Stealth check to Conceal an Object; you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to this check due to the tracking bug's size.</p><p>Once you plant a tracking bug, you can use a custom app (included in the tracking bug's Price) to follow the tracking bug with a successful Computers check (typically DC appropriate to the level of the threat) using a computer, comm unit, or similar device; the GM should adjust this DC to reflect environmental conditions and other factors. You must be on the same plane and planet as the bug for the app to function. A fully charged tracking bug lasts 1 day. When the bug runs out of power, you can't follow it until you recharge it.</p>"
