When you get this augmentation, you either increase your Intelligence modifier by 1 or increase it to +4, whichever would give you a higher value. This gives you additional trained skills and languages, as normal for increasing your Intelligence modifier. You must select skills and languages when the augmentation is first installed, and they can't be changed.</p><p><strong>Activate—Access Database</strong> <span class=\"pf2-icon\">1</span> (concentrate)</p><p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p><strong>Effect</strong> Immediately attempt three checks to Recall Knowledge about related topics, selecting each topic after learning the results of the prior checks. For example, you could Recall Knowledge about a specific person, then their home world, then a creature or settlement on that world. If you would fail one of these checks, you succeed instead, and if you would critically fail, you instead fail normally. For these actions, you can't use any other special abilities, reactions, or free actions that trigger when you Recall Knowledge.</p>"
