Whenever you enter a vacuum, you temporarily gain the cosmic trait. You have this trait for as long as you remain in a vacuum, up to a maximum of 1 hour. Creatures with the cosmic trait don't need to breathe while in space or a vacuum and are immune to the harmful environmental effects of being in space.</p>",
