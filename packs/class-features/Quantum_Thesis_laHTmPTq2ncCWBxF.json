You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot you can use to cast these spells, using witchwarper spellcasting. Unlike other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, and they can't be used for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or abilities that give you more spell slots. You can take the @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.feats.Item.1FpIDO6kCOiIR1KE]{Quantum Research} witchwarper feat to gain a second slot.</p>"
