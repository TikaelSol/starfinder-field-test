Somehow, your sheer bravado and over-the-top actions have a way of working out for you, despite logic often suggesting otherwise. To you, there's no problem that a copious amount of bullets or laser blasts can't cure, though you can sometimes mix it up and find other solutions if you need. You've become a specialist at wielding automatic weapons and can employ them to devastating effect when confronted with foes.</p><p>When you successfully make a ranged Strike with a weapon with the automatic trait, you @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.conditions.Item.enA7BxAjBb7ns1iF]{Suppress} the target until the start of your next turn. In addition, when you @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.actions.Item.6ctkxUnVwqooSvgg]{Auto-Fire}, the size of the cone is equal to the weapon's full range increment instead of half. When using the Auto-Fire action, you can designate a target anywhere in the cone to be your primary target instead of the target closest to you.</p>"
