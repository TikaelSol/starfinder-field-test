      "value": "<p>Your deep understanding of the stellar forces of the universe manifests in a variety of tangible ways. You can create and maintain all three different manifestations: solar flare, a solar nimbus, and a solar weapon. Your manifestations temporarily vanish if you become unattuned.</p><h3>Solar Flare</h3><p>A small mote of solar power hovers nearby or appears embedded on some part of your body, such as the palm of your hand or on your face. This flare of energy can unleash energy in a short range. Your solar flare is otherwise treated as a martial ranged weapon in the brawling weapon group.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.actions.Item.0o7v0LwOjvvNJRCw]{Solar Shot}</p><h3>Solar Nimbus</h3><p>A layer of photonic energy surrounds you, overlaying your body or worn armor. This layer of star stuff provides you with protection that works alongside existing armor. It appears as a layer of glowing light or solid darkness, depending on your current state of attunement. The general appearance and shape of the nimbus is your choice and could appear as a thin layer of energy or imposing spiked energy armor layered atop your existing equipment. This design has no impact on its function and doesn't provide any additional bonuses.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.actions.Item.fy5RQYfWhum3Bz9H]{Nimbus Surge}</p><h3>Solar Weapon</h3><p>Through sheer will, you can call forth a tangible weapon comprised of the essence of stars. When you Attune, you can manifest your weapon as part of the action. When manifesting your weapon, it appears in a free hand of your choice, unless it has the free-hand trait, at which point it can manifest in any hand. Your solar weapon is a martial melee weapon. It deals 1d8 of your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. You can select up to two of the following traits for your weapon. Alternatively, you can select the reach or two-hand 1d10 trait for your weapon instead of selecting two of the following traits.</p><ul><li>Disarm</li><li>Free-Hand</li><li>Grapple</li><li>Nonlethal</li><li>Parry</li><li>Shove</li><li>Sweep</li><li>Trip</li><li>Versatile (B/P/S only)</li></ul><p>You can select one of the following weapon groups for your weapon to be a part of.</p><ul><li>Axe</li><li>Brawling</li><li>Club</li><li>Flail</li><li>Hammer</li><li>Knife</li><li>Pick</li><li>Polearm</li><li>Spear</li><li>Sword</li></ul><p>You can change the properties of your solar weapon through the @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.actions.Item.7p3HC6xc2ui6fU3V]{Re-Forge Solar Weapon} activity. Your solar weapon gains additional benefits based on your current attunement.</p><p><strong>Graviton-Attuned</strong> When you successfully Strike a creature using your solar weapon, that creature treats all squares adjacent to the square where they were struck as being difficult terrain until the end of its next turn.</p><p><strong>Photon-Attuned</strong> When you successfully Strike a creature with your solar weapon, you deal an additional amount of fire damage equal to half your level (rounded up).</p>"
