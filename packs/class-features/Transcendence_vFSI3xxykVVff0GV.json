You gain a single 10th-rank spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using mystic spellcasting. Unlike with other spell slots, you can't use 10th-rank slots with abilities that give you more spell slots or that let you cast spells without expending spell slots. You don't gain more 10th-rank spells as you level up, but you can take the @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.feats.Item.dCvAYFESkGyur1yw]{Transcended Existence} feat to gain a second slot.</p>"
