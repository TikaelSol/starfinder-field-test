Whether you're a mugger, a bodyguard, an assassin, or an urban mercenary, you favor pistols and can use them efficiently in tight spaces. You're trained in Acrobatics. You gain a skill feat for Acrobatics.</p><p><strong>Exploit:</strong> You're adept at utilizing pistols in close combat and can employ them in a fight just as well as some might use a sword. Your ranged Strikes with one-handed ranged weapons don't trigger reactions that are triggered by a ranged attack. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.feats.Item.TmM2RY93qR25KU8D]{Hair Trigger} feat as a bonus feat.</p><p><strong>Enhanced Exploit:</strong> Your point-blank shots are particularly deadly. When you make a successful Strike against an adjacent enemy with a one-handed ranged weapon, you calculate the damage as if the lowest-rolled weapon damage die for the attack had the maximum result instead. At 17th level, the two lowest-rolled damage dice increase to the maximum result.</p>"
