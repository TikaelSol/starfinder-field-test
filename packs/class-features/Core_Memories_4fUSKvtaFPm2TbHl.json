They might be a series of formative events in your life, such as key turning points, critical decisions, or the serendipitous events which led you to meet someone important to you. Whatever the nature and number of your memories, you can focus on them to remind yourself which of the infinite possible realities impacts you the most: your own.</p><p><strong>Anchor Benefit</strong> You can access core memories from a small part of you that still exists in another reality.
