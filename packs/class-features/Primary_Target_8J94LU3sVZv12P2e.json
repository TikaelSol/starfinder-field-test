Ignore the unwieldy trait on your weapon when using this action. If two or more creatures are equidistant or closest, you can choose which one is your primary target. If you successfully hit your primary target with this Strike and the target rolls a success against your Area Fire or Auto-Fire action, they get a failure instead. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty.</p>"
