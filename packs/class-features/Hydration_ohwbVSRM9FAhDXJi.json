You must submerge in water in order to rehydrate your water-acclimated skin.</p><p>If you fail to do this, your skin begins to crack and your gills become painful. After the first 24 hours outside of water, you take a -1 status penalty to Fortitude saves. After 48 hours, you struggle to breathe air and begin to suffocate until returned to water.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feat-effects.Item.Q5FUu7yhWPJlcXei]{Effect: Dehydrated}</p>",
