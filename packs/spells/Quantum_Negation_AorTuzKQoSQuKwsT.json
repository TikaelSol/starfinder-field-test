If it is destroyed, it ceases to exist in this reality. At the GM's discretion, this may mean it's impossible to restore them to life without the intervention of a deity, wish, or similar magic.</p>\n<p><strong>15th or lower</strong> The target takes @Damage[15d10[void]] void damage with a basic Will save.</p>\n<p><strong>16th or 17th</strong> If the target has 40 Hit Points or fewer, it drops to 0 Hit Points and becomes @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.yZRUzMqrMmfLu0V1]{Dying 1}; otherwise, it takes @Damage[12d10[void]] void damage with a basic Will save.</p>\n<p><strong>18th or higher</strong> The target takes @Damage[8d10[void]] void damage damage with a basic will save. If this brings it to 0 Hit Points, it dies instantly.</p>"
