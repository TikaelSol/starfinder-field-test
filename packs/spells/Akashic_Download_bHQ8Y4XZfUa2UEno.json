When you Cast this Spell, choose any skill in which you are at least trained that has the Recall Knowledge action. You can check the file on your comm unit when attempting a Recall Knowledge check using your chosen skill. This is part of the action to Recall Knowledge. You must be holding the comm unit to do so. The file instantly compiles and displays snippets and selections from various media relevant to the topic. This grants you a +1 status bonus on the Recall Knowledge check. If you roll a critical failure on this check, you get a failure instead. If the check is successful and the subject is a creature, you gain additional information or context about the creature. Once you reference the comm unit, the spell ends. When the spell ends, your access to the Akashic Record ends and all the information you downloaded returns to the Akashic Record.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> The status bonus increases to +2 and you can reference your comm unit twice before the spell ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> The status bonus increases to +3 and you can reference your comm unit three times before the spell ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> The status bonus increases to +4 and you can reference your comm unit four times before the spell ends.</p>"
