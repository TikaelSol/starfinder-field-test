The object appears to animate naturally, but it doesn't make sounds or generate smells. For example, lights would appear to blink on the exterior of an illusory computer server, but it would be silent and wouldn't produce heat. Any creature that touches the image or uses the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.BlAOM2X92SI6HMtJ]{Seek} action to examine it can attempt to disbelieve your illusion.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (2nd)</strong> Your hologram makes the appropriate sounds, generates normal smells, and feels right to the touch. The spell gains the auditory and olfactory traits. The duration increases to 1 hour.</p><p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> As the 2nd-rank version, but the duration is unlimited.</p>"
