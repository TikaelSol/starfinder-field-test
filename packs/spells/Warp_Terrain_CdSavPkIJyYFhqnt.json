Choose one of the following effects, which lasts as long as your quantum field remains active, until you cast warp terrain again, or you dismiss this spell.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You cause the area of your quantum field to become difficult terrain. You determine the appearance of the warped terrain. You and your allies can move through warped terrain normally and can @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.ust1jJSCZQUhBZIz]{Take Cover} using its features.</li>\n<li>You suppress terrain in your aura, turning any existing difficult or greater difficult terrain in your quantum field to become normal terrain. This does not apply to effects that cause a creature to count squares as difficult terrain (such as a solarian's graviton-attunement attacks). If you're attempting to suppress terrain created by a spell or other magical effect, you must successfully counteract the effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (3rd)</strong> You cause the warped terrain to fill with fog, smoke, or another phenomenon that obscures vision. This functions as mist .</p>\n<p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> You can choose to have the quantum field become greater difficult terrain instead of difficult terrain.</p>"
