When it moves, the target takes the safest route and doesn't enter hazardous terrain. The spell has a duration of 1 minute, or until the target is attacked or otherwise directly threatened in any way.</p><p><strong>Critical Failure</strong>: As failure, except the target babbles incoherently. Any creature that begins their turn within 20 feet of the target must attempt a Will saving throw as if they were targeted by this spell. On a failure, they become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.yblD8fOR1J8rDwEQ]{Confused} for 1 round and immune to this spell for 24 hours. This is an incapacitation effect.</p>"
