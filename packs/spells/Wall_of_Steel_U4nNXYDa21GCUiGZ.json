You can shape the wall's path, placing each 5 feet of the wall on the border between squares. The wall doesn't need to stand vertically, so you can use it to form a bridge or set of stairs, for example. You must conjure the wall in an unbroken open space so its edges don't pass through any creatures or objects, or the spell is lost. Each 10-foot-by-10-foot section of the wall has AC 10, Hardness 18, and 60 Hit Points, and it's immune to critical hits and precision damage. A destroyed section of the wall can be moved through, but the rubble created from it is difficult terrain.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (+1)</strong> The Hit Points of each section of the wall increase by 15.</p>"
