Your armor can only store one spell in this way; you can't cast <em>activate defense firewall</em> while you are under the effect of <em>activate defense firewall</em>. </p><p>When a creature touches or damages you with an unarmed melee attack or non-reach melee weapon, you can Cast the Spell as a reaction, targeting the triggering creature; the triggering creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} against this spell. Only the creature who triggered the reaction is affected by the spell. </p><p>You can Dismiss <em>active defense firewall</em>. If you do, the prepared spell slot used to cast the spell modified by <em>active defense firewall</em> is recovered, but the spell is not. The empty spell slot can be used to prepare a spell with Download Spell.</p>"
