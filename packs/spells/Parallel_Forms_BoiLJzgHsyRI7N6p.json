If the actions are both attacks, they must target a different creature and use the same multiple attack penalty, counting as one attack toward your multiple attack penalty. Each round you Sustain the spell, your parallel forms share actions, using the same multiple attack penalty if both attack as though you had made both attacks. You apply damage to both forms to your current Hit Points, but if both forms take damage from the same effect such as from an attack or spell with area damage, you only apply the damage once. In the case of an effect with a save that affects both forms, you take the worse result and apply it to both forms. When the spell ends, you choose one of the two forms as your actual form and the other version of you disappears. The spell automatically ends if you are reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> Your parallel forms are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.nlCjDvLMf2EkV2dl]{Quickened} and can use the extra action to Step, Stride, or Strike.</p>"
