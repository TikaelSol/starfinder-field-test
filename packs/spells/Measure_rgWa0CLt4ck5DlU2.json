If an object or creature extends out of the area, you learn only the measurements within the area, but nothing about what you can't observe. For example, you can't determine the thickness or weight of a wall you can observe only one side of, or the depth of water that extends beyond the spell's range. Each time you Sustain the spell, you learn the exact measurements of one creature of object in the area, including imprecisions or anomalies that might indicate structural weakness. Magically altered targets give you information that reflects what you observe rather than accurate measurements.</p>"
