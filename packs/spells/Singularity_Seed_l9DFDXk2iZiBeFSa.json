      "value": "<p><strong>Area</strong> 50-foot radius, 100-foot-tall cylinder</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A tiny particle of incredibly dense mass magically blossoms into a gravitational singularity. You create a singularity in a 5-foot square that is unoccupied by any creatures. All creatures and unsecured objects in the area are moved toward the singularity when the spell is cast, at the end of their turn, and whenever they use an action to move within the area, all depending on their Reflex saving throws. This follows the rules for forced movement. If there's not enough space near the center of the singularity, creatures and objects nearer to the center move first, and others move as far as they can without being blocked, up to the amount set by their saving throw outcomes. A creature within the area of the spell reduces its Speed by half when moving away from the singularity, but can move double its Speed when moving toward it. A creature or object that enters or occupies the square containing the singularity at the start of its turn takes 10d10 void damage. A creature in the singularity can take no actions except an Athletics check against your spell DC to @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.SkZAQRkLLkmBQNB9]{Escape} the singularity. If a creature was moved into the singularity when it attempted to use a move action and Escapes on the same turn, it can complete the movement without spending an action or attempting an additional Reflex saving throw. Multiple creatures can occupy the square containing the singularity, as they're considered in an extradimensional space. When the spell ends, the singularity disappears, and creatures and objects that were sucked into the singularity appear in the space where you conjured it (or as close as possible to that space, if they can't all fit within it). When the spell is cast, or when creatures move within the area, or end their turn within the area must attempt a Reflex save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The creature is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The creature moves 10 feet toward the center.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> The creature moves 20 feet toward the center.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> The creature moves 30 feet toward the center.</p>"
