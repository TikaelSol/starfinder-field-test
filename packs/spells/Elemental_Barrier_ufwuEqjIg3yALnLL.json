Select an elemental trait: air, earth, fire, metal, water, or wood. Elemental barrier gains the trait you chose. The target gets a +1 circumstance bonus to AC. While the spell is in effect, the target can use the Shield Block reaction as if the elemental barrier was a raised shield. The barrier has Hardness 6 and 20 HP. The increases its Hardness by 2 to one damage type based on the chosen trait: electricity or sonic for air, bludgeoning or piercing for earth, acid or slashing for metal, fire for fire, cold for water, or poison for wood. Unlike a normal Shield Block, you can use the spell's reaction against spells with the chosen elemental trait cast against the creature.</p><p>@UUID[Compendium.starfinder-field-test-for-pf2e.conditions.Item.xK3oQUWYXlJ6z49T]{Spell Effect: Elemental Barrier}</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (4th)</strong> The barrier has 40 HP.</p><p><strong>Heightened (5th)</strong> The barrier has 48 HP.</p><p><strong>Heightened (6th)</strong> The barrier has Hardness 8 and 52 HP.</p><p><strong>Heightened (7th)</strong> The barrier has Hardness 8 and 60 HP.</p><p><strong>Heightened (8th)</strong> The barrier has Hardness 10 and 68 HP.</p><p><strong>Heightened (9th)</strong> The barrier has Hardness 10 and 80 HP.</p>"
