If you issue an obviously selfdestructive order to a sapient target, the target does not act until you issue a new order. The effect depends on its Will save.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target is unaffected.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> The target is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 1} as it fights off your commands.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You control the target. It gains the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.9qGBRpbX9NEwtAAr]{Controlled} condition, but it can attempt a Will save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As a failure, but the target receives a new save only if it's sapient and you give it a new order that is against its nature, such as killing its allies.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Heightened (10th)</strong> The duration is unlimited.</p>"
