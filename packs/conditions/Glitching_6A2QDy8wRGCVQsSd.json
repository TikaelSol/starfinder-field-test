A glitching creature or object experiences a combination of debilitating effects and moments of seizing up. If you have glitching equipment and take any action involving that equipment, you must attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:10] to see what occurs. If you have the glitching condition on yourself, you must make this flat check at the beginning of every round.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> Reduce the glitching value by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Success</strong> You act as normal or use your equipment as normal.</p>\n<p><strong>Failure</strong> You take an item penalty on all your checks and DCs equal to your glitching value or the glitching value on the item you're attempting to use.</p>\n<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You count as @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.dfCMdR4wnpbYNTix]{Stunned 1} for the round. Alternatively, the object you tried to use doesn't function, and you lose the actions you took to attempt to use it.</p>"
